What significant event led to the establishment of Carnegie Mellon University?,"

Andrew Carnegie, a Scottish-American industrialist, made his fortune primarily through the steel industry. In 1892, during a period of intense labor unrest in the United States, the Homestead Strike took place at the Homestead Steel Works, which was then owned by Andrew Carnegie.

The strike lasted for several months and resulted in significant loss of life and property damage. The strike also drew widespread national attention and ultimately led to a number of important labor law reforms in the United States.
