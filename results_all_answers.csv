"According to the provided text, how may employers compute their payroll expense attributable to the City of Pittsburgh if their employees perform work partly within and partly outside of the city?",Specific information questions,General Info and History of Pittsburgh/CMU,Use each employee’s working hours within Pittsburgh compared to their total working hours.,"

Employers can compute their payroll expense attributable to the City of Pittsburgh by using a percentage method based on the location of work. 

For example, if an employee spends 70% of their work time in the City of Pittsburgh and 30% outside of the city, then the employer would allocate 70% of the employee's payroll expense to the City of Pittsburgh and 30% to the area outside of the city.","

            Employers whose employees perform work partly within and partly outside of the City of Pittsburgh, may compute their payroll expense attributable to the City of Pittsburgh by using the percentage of total number of working hours employed within the City of Pittsburgh compared to the total number of hours employed (within and outside) the City for each individual employee.","

            Employers whose employees perform work partly within and partly outside of the City of Pittsburgh must apportion their payroll expense to the portion attributable to the City of Pittsburgh.

            The resulting percentage represents the proportion of the employer's payroll expense that is attributable to work performed by its employees within the City of Pittsburgh.

What significant event led to the establishment of Carnegie Mellon University?,Document-enhanced questions,General Info and History of Pittsburgh/CMU,The 1967 merger of Carnegie Tech and the Mellon Institute.,"

Andrew Carnegie, a Scottish-American industrialist, made his fortune primarily through the steel industry. In 1892, during a period of intense labor unrest in the United States, the Homestead Strike took place at the Homestead Steel Works, which was then owned by Andrew Carnegie.

The strike lasted for several months and resulted in significant loss of life and property damage. The strike also drew widespread national attention and ultimately led to a number of important labor law reforms in the United States.

In the aftermath of the Homestead Strike, Andrew Carnegie decided to sell his controlling interest in the Homestead Steel Works to J.P. Morgan for $25 million. Carnegie used the proceeds from the sale to fund the establishment of the Carnegie Institute, which was later renamed Carnegie Mellon University.

Carnegie Mellon University was founded on April 19, 1900, and was originally located in Oakland, a borough of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

            Only emergency vehicles and Port Authority buses will be allowed to travel in both directions on East Carson Street during the hours of 7pm to 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. This restriction is being put in place to help ensure that emergency responders are able to reach their destinations quickly and efficiently, without being hindered by heavy traffic congestion.

            Ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft will not be permitted to stop on East Carson Street between S. 10th and S. 18th Streets during the hours of 7pm to 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. This restriction is being put in place to help ensure that ride-sharing services are able to pick up and drop off passengers efficiently, without causing unnecessary congestion or hindering emergency responders from reaching their destinations quickly and efficiently.

            Parking and deliveries will be prohibited on either side of East Carson Street between 7pm and 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. This restriction is being put in place to help ensure that parking and delivery activities do not contribute to unnecessary congestion or hinder emergency responders from reaching their destinations quickly and efficiently.

            Side streets from S. 11th to S. 17th inclusive will be closed to traffic during the hours of 7pm to 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. This closure is being put in place to help ensure that side streets do not contribute to unnecessary congestion or hinder emergency responders from reaching their destinations quickly and efficiently.

            Only residents will be allowed to enter these areas during the hours of 7pm to 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. This restriction is being put in place to help ensure that side streets do not contribute to unnecessary congestion or hinder emergency responders from reaching their destinations quickly and efficiently, while also ensuring that residents are able to access their properties during these hours.

            All feedback is welcomed to the City 3-1-1 Response Center (Dial 311 or 412-255-2621). The 9-1-1 system should always be used for emergencies.

            We appreciate everyone’s patience during this second weekend of adjustments. Areas designated with No Parking signs will be heavily enforced. The Department of Public Safety recognizes the slight inconvenience, but the overall goal of increased safety, overcrowded sidewalks and street traffic needed to be addressed.","

            Due to a partial building collapse in the 1600 block of E. Carson Street, Public Safety is temporarily halting its traffic calming pilot project. The demolition process will require the closure of E. Carson Street between S.16th and S.17th streets. During this time, traffic will be diverted around this block. Tractor trailers and longer industrial-type vehicles will need to divert via the 10th Street Bridge or the Birmingham Bridge. The traffic pilot project implemented on July 30 will NOT be in place for the time being. Some businesses on this block will be impacted during the demolition. There is no timeline for its completion. Public Safety would like to thank residents, business owners, and visitors to Pittsburgh for their patience and understanding with these last minute changes and the inconvenience they may cause.","

            Due to a partial building collapse in the 1600 block of E. Carson Street on August 12, 2021, Public Safety is temporarily halting its traffic calming pilot project. The upper level of a two-story building sustained severe damage during heavy rainstorms and engineers are concerned the integrity of the structure, and that of the adjacent buildings, may be compromised. As such, Public Safety will be closing E. Carson Street between S.16th and S.17th streets to begin the demolition of 1604 E. Carson. A large crane has been staged in the street to begin that process. During this time, traffic will be diverted around this block. Tractor trailers and longer industrial-type vehicles will need to divert via the 10th Street Bridge or the Birmingham Bridge. As stated earlier, the traffic pilot project implemented on July 30 will NOT be in place for the time being. Some businesses on this block will be impacted during the demolition. There is no timeline for its completion. This is an evolving situation and Public Safety will provide information to the public as it becomes available.

What is the origin of Pittsburgh's shared black and gold color scheme among its professional sports teams?,Specific information questions,Sports,"Pittsburgh's black and gold colors originated with the Steelers (1933), followed by the Pirates (1948), and Penguins (1979), despite Bruins opposition.", Pittsburgh's shared black and gold color scheme among its professional sports teams originated from the colors of two of Pittsburgh's most successful sports teams: the Pittsburgh Pirates (black and gold) and the Pittsburgh Steelers (also black and gold). The convergence of these two teams' success and their shared color scheme led to the adoption of black and gold as the signature colors of Pittsburgh's professional sports scene.,"

            The origin of Pittsburgh's shared black and gold color scheme among its professional sports teams can be traced back to the late 19th century when the city was known for its industrial strength and economic prosperity.

            During this period, Pittsburgh had several professional sports teams that represented the city in various leagues. These teams included the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, the Pittsburgh Steelers football team, and the Pittsburgh Hornets basketball team.

            While each of these teams had their unique identities and traditions, they all shared a common bond in representing the city of Pittsburgh on the national stage.

            To further strengthen this connection and create a sense of unity among the city's professional sports teams, it was decided that they would all adopt a shared color scheme based on the colors of the city flag - black and gold.

            This decision was made official in 1948 when the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team replaced their traditional blue and red uniforms with the new black and gold color scheme.

            The success of this change in the Pirates' uniform design not only helped to solidify the shared black and gold color scheme among Pittsburgh's professional sports teams but also inspired other cities with multiple professional sports teams to adopt similar color schemes based on their city flags.

            When Pittsburgh was founded in 1758, it was named after its founder, John Forbes, who was a Scottish soldier and politician. Forbes was a close friend and ally of William Pitt, and he adopted Pitt's coat of arms as his own personal emblem.

            As Pittsburgh grew and developed into a thriving industrial city, its professional sports teams began to adopt the black and gold colors as their own distinctive team hues.

            The first professional sports team in Pittsburgh to adopt the black and gold colors was the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, which traces its origins back to 1882 when the team was founded as the Allegheny Base Ball Club. In 1890, the team changed its name to the Pittsburgh Pirates, and it adopted the black and gold colors as its official team hues in 1948.

            The second professional sports team in Pittsburgh to adopt the black and gold colors was the Pittsburgh Steelers football team, which was founded in 1933 as the Pittsburgh Pirates football team. In 1940, the team changed its name to the Pittsburgh Steelers, and it adopted the black and gold colors as its official team hues in 1962.

            The third professional sports team in Pittsburgh to adopt the black and gold colors was the Pittsburgh Penguins ice hockey team, which was founded in 1945 as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League (AHL). In 1946, the team changed its name to the Pittsburgh Bears, and it adopted the black and gold colors as its official team hues in 1953. However, in 1955, the team changed its name once again to the Pittsburgh Penguins, and it continued to use the black and gold colors as its official team hues to this day.
