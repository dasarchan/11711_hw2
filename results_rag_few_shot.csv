            Employers whose employees perform work partly within and partly outside of the City of Pittsburgh must apportion their payroll expense to the portion attributable to the City of Pittsburgh. 

            To compute this amount, employers should first determine the total compensation paid to all employees who performed any work in the City of Pittsburgh during the tax year. 

            Next, employers should determine the total compensation paid to all employees who performed any work outside of the City of Pittsburgh during the tax year. 

            Finally, employers should apportion their total payroll expense for the tax year based on the percentage of total compensation paid to employees who performed work in the City of Pittsburgh versus those who performed work outside of the City of Pittsburgh. 

            The resulting amount is the employer's payroll expense attributable to the City of Pittsburgh.",,,,,

            Due to a partial building collapse in the 1600 block of E. Carson Street on August 12, 2021, Public Safety is temporarily halting its traffic calming pilot project. The upper level of a two-story building sustained severe damage during heavy rainstorms and engineers are concerned the integrity of the structure, and that of the adjacent buildings, may be compromised. As such, Public Safety will be closing E. Carson Street between S.16th and S.17th streets to begin the demolition of 1604 E. Carson. A large crane has been staged in the street to begin that process. During this time, traffic will be diverted around this block. Tractor trailers and longer industrial-type vehicles will need to divert via the 10th Street Bridge or the Birmingham Bridge. As stated earlier, the traffic pilot project implemented on July 30 will NOT be in place for the time being. Some businesses on this block will be impacted during the demolition. There is no timeline for its completion. This is an evolving situation and Public Safety will provide information to the public as it becomes available.
