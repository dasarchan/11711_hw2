What phone number should be included on a pet's identification tag?, The phone number that should be included on a pet's identification tag is the phone number of the pet owner. This will help ensure that the pet can be easily and quickly reunited with its owner if it gets lost.,"  Be proactive! Nobody expects a pet to go missing, so your pet should always wear a collar with an ID tag that has your phone number on it. Check the tag regularly to ensure it is still readable. Have your pet spayed or neutered. In addition to all the health benefits, it decreases an animal's desire to roam away from home. Pittsburgh residents are eligible for the City's free spay/neuter program for up to 5 pets! Check out the Spay/Neuter Program tab for an application and details. Get your pet microchipped this permanent form of ID can't be detached or obscured. Local shelters offer microchips at reduced rates. Make sure to keep your information updated with the microchip company if you move or get a new phone number Take photos of your pet (as if we had to ask you to do that!). Be sure to keep a few current ones on hand for emergency purposes If your pet has gotten away from you, call the local shelters. The open door shelter in Pittsburgh is Humane Animal Rescue at 412-345-7300. You need to file a lost report with them in case someone finds your pet. However, because descriptions may vary (you might call your dog tan while a shelter worker calls him yellow), it is best to visit the shelters in person. Making a flyer complete with color photos of your pet will help! You can bring a copy of the flyer to local shelters, post flyers around your neighborhood, and post the information to social media sites. Any animal picked up by Pittsburgh Animal Care and Control is taken to the Animal Rescue League, so if you've filed your lost report with them, you are covered if your pet is picked up by our officers","  Any dogs running loose will be picked up and impounded by Police and Animal Control officers Licensed dogs and ID tagged cats: The owner will be contacted, and the animal will be held for 10 days at the Humane Animal Rescue - East End at the corner of Hamilton and Dallas Avenues in Homewood. The owner of the pet may claim his animal after paying for costs and charges paid by the City for picking up and taking care of the animal. Animals may be adopted or euthanized after 10 days following the notification of the owner.

What is the name of the 42-story building erected by the University of Pittsburgh that currently stands as the world's fourth-tallest educational building?, The Cathedral of Learning.,"  High culture[edit] Oakland became the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world's fourth-tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning.[61] It towered over Forbes Field, where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970.[39]","         Cathedral of Learning       Cathedral of Learning and Oakland  Throughout Oakland, you are likely to be within feet of seeing the Cathedral of Learning.The University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning is the tallest building dedicated to university education in the western hemisphere. The Cathedral's first three floors have thirty different classrooms dedicated to some of the cultures that have contributed to the growth of the city and the University. The Nationality Rooms are open to tours and even hold classes at the University. The lobbyof this Late Gothic Revival building, known as the Commons Room, is three floors tall and offers tremendous views. It often hosts nationality festivals, college functions, and more. The 36th floor is the highest floor open to the public of any building in the city of Pittsburgh. Right near the building are the world-renowned institutions such as the Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, the Oakland branch of the Carnegie Library, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, Carnegie Mellon University, and more. The best way to see everything that Oakland has to offer is to simply take a walk through the neighborhood. On the Friday night of Pitt's homecoming weekend in the fall, they shoot fireworks off of each of the tiers of the building. If the Pitt football team wins, you will see the dazzling orange victory lights on top of the building.","   Education  There’s a reason Pittsburgh is among the top cities for educated young people – our more than 30 colleges and universities are at the heart of a renaissance that earned the city its reputation as a global leader in education.

What factors contributed to the Pittsburgh Penguins' growth in popularity?,"

            The Pittsburgh Penguins' growth in popularity can be attributed to several factors:

            1. Success on the ice: The Penguins have had a strong presence in the NHL, winning six Eastern Conference titles and five Stanley Cup championships. This success has helped to build a loyal fan base.

            2. Strong ownership: The Penguins have been fortunate to have strong ownership throughout their history. Mario Lemieux, a Hall of Fame player, bought the team out of bankruptcy in 1999 and served as both owner and CEO until 2007. Since then, the team has been owned by Fenway Sports Group.

            3. Strong community ties: The Penguins have always had strong community ties, which has helped to build a loyal fan base. For example, the team's mascot, Iceburgh, is a beloved figure in the Pittsburgh community. Additionally, the team has a strong commitment to giving back to the community through various charitable initiatives.

            4. Strong marketing and branding: The Penguins have always had a strong marketing and branding presence, which has helped to build a loyal fan base. For example, the team's logo, which features a penguin wearing a hockey helmet and holding a hockey stick, is a beloved figure in the Pittsburgh community. Additionally, the team has a strong commitment to innovation and technology, which has helped to keep the team's marketing and branding efforts fresh and engaging for fans.

            5. Strong media coverage: The Penguins have always had strong media coverage, both locally and nationally, which has helped to build a loyal fan base. For example, the team's home games are regularly covered in depth by local sports media outlets, such as the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and 93.7 The Fan. Additionally, the team's national media coverage is also strong, with regular appearances on major sports networks, such as ESPN and NBC Sports.

            6. Strong fan engagement: The Penguins have always had a strong commitment to engaging with their fans, both in person and online, which has helped to build a loyal fan base. For example, the team regularly hosts fan events, such as autograph sessions, meet-and-greets, and fan festivals, which give fans the opportunity to interact with their favorite players and team personnel in person. Additionally, the team also has a strong online presence, with regular updates on the team's website, social media channels, and mobile app, which give fans the ability to stay connected to the team and engage with other fans online, no matter where they are in the world.

            7. Strong community partnerships: The Penguins have always had a strong commitment to building and maintaining strong community partnerships, both locally and nationally, which has helped to build a loyal fan base. For example, the team regularly partners with local charities, schools, and community organizations to support their initiatives and make a positive impact on the lives of people in the Pittsburgh community. Additionally, the team also has a strong national presence, with regular partnerships with major national charities, such as the American Cancer Society, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and the Special Olympics, among others, which give the team the opportunity to make a positive impact on the lives of people across the country.

            8. Strong organizational structure: The Penguins have always had a strong organizational structure, both on and off the ice, which has helped to build a successful franchise and a loyal fan base. For example, the team has a strong management team, led by President and CEO David Morehouse, who is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the team's business operations, including marketing, sponsorships, community relations, ticket sales, merchandise sales, and finance and administration. Additionally, the team also has a strong hockey operations department, led by General Manager Jim Rutherford, who is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the team's on-ice operations, including player personnel, scouting, coaching, training, and game strategy and analysis.

            9. Strong commitment to innovation and technology: The Penguins have always had a strong commitment to innovation and technology, both on and off the ice, which has helped to keep the team at the forefront of the NHL and a popular destination for fans. For example, the team was one of the first in the league to adopt advanced statistical analysis tools, such as War-on-Ice and Hockey Analysis, to help identify trends and patterns in player performance and team strategy, which has helped the team to make more informed decisions on roster moves, trades, and free agent signings. Additionally, the team also has a strong commitment to using technology to enhance the fan experience both at home and at the arena. For example, the team offers a mobile app that allows fans to access real-time statistics, game highlights, and player interviews, as well as the ability to purchase tickets, merchandise, and food and beverage vouchers, all from the convenience of their smartphones. Additionally, the team also offers in-arena Wi-Fi connectivity, which allows fans to stay connected to the internet and access real-time statistics, game highlights, and player interviews, as well as the ability to purchase tickets, merchandise","  Fanbase Iceburgh, the mascot of the Pittsburgh Penguins Despite Pittsburgh's long history with hockey and a small but loyal fanbase, the Penguins struggled with fan support early on in its history, at times averaging only 6,000 fans per game when Civic Arena had a seating capacity of over 16,000. Fan support was so low by the team's first bankruptcy that the NHL had no problem with the team being moved, something that would change decades later when the team faced another relocation threat. While the drafting of Mario Lemieux piqued interest in hockey locally, fans remained skeptical. John Steigerwald, brother of former Penguins broadcaster Paul Steigerwald,[98] noted in his autobiography that upon his arrival at KDKA-TV from WTAE-TV in 1985, the station cared more about the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League than the Penguins.[99] However, Lemieux's play steadily grew the fanbase in the area, which would only be reassured upon the arrival of Sidney Crosby after the team struggled both on the ice and in attendance following the Jaromir Jagr trade. Today, the Penguins are one of the NHL's most popular teams, especially among American non-Original Six franchises, and are considered second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams, taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates struggles both on and off the field.[100] Especially notable was a 2007 survey done of the four major sports leagues' 122 teams. The Penguins surprised observers by being ranked 20th overall and third among NHL teams, while the Steelers were ranked number one and the Pirates (before the arrival of Andrew McCutchen and that team's turnaround)[101] ranked much lower on the list than its peers. The Penguins' popularity has at times rivaled that of the Steelers at the local level.[102]","  Fanbase[edit] Bing Crosby co-owned the Pirates from 1946 until his death in 1977. Even though they have had some notable fans including former part-owner Bing Crosby, Michael Keaton, and Regis Philbin,[107] the Pirates are considered by most to be a distant third in Pittsburgh behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Penguins in popularity among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams.[108] However, due to their long history in Pittsburgh dating back to the 1882 season, the team has retained a strong loyal following in the Pittsburgh region, especially among older residents. Upon the team ending their 20-season losing season streak with a winning season in 2013, the fan support for the club has grown once again but still remaining a distant third behind the city's other 2 more successful franchises in the last half-century. While the team's recent struggles compared to Pittsburgh's other two teams can be partly to blame (since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979, the Steelers have won the Super Bowl 3 times (XIV, XL, and XLIII) and the Penguins the Stanley Cup five times in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017, including both in 2009), distractions off the field have also caused the team's popularity to slip in the city. While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s,[109] the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985 and two relocation threats since are believed to have also seen the team's popularity dipped.[110] The team's standing among fans has, however, improved along with the team on the field and the opening of PNC Park in 2001.[111] Following the Andrew McCutchen trade in 2018, fan relations have deteriorated despite the Pirates contending for the NL Central during 2018 due to backlash towards owner Robert Nutting, with the team ranking 27th among 30 MLB team in attendance that season.[112] When the Penguins won the Stanley Cup in 2009 captain Sidney Crosby brought the cup to PNC Park on the Sunday following the team's victory in Detroit. When they won again in 2017 the cup was once again brought to PNC Park and the team threw out the first pitch. The team won the cup in 1992 and they held a celebration in the Pirates' old home Three Rivers Stadium.","   History Early years (1967–1984) Prior to the arrival of the Penguins, Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates from 1925 to 1930 and of the American Hockey League's Pittsburgh Hornets franchise from 1936 to 1967 (with a short break from 1956 to 1961). In the spring of 1965, Jack McGregor, a state senator from Kittanning, Pennsylvania, began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that included H. J. Heinz Company heir H. J. Heinz III, Pittsburgh Steelers' owner Art Rooney and the Mellon family's Richard Mellon Scaife. The projected league expansion depended on securing votes from the then-current NHL owners; to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from James D. Norris, owner of the Chicago Black Hawks and his brother Bruce Norris, owner of the Detroit Red Wings. The effort was successful, and on February 8, 1966, the National Hockey League awarded an expansion team to Pittsburgh for the 1967–68 season. The Penguins paid $2.5 million ($24.5 million today) for their entry and $750,000 ($7.1 million today) more for start-up costs.

The Penguins compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The team has played its home games at PPG Paints Arena since 2010, and has previously played at the Civic Arena, which was better known by its nickname ""the Igloo"". The Penguins are affiliated with two minor league teams – the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Wheeling Nailers of the ECHL. Founded during the 1967 expansion, the Penguins have qualified for six Stanley Cup Finals, winning the Stanley Cup five times – in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017. Along with the Edmonton Oilers, the Penguins are tied for the most Stanley Cup championships among the non-Original Six teams and sixth overall. With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017, the Penguins became the first back-to-back champions in the salary cap era. Several of the team's former members have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, including co-owner Mario Lemieux, who purchased the Penguins in 1999 and brought the club out of bankruptcy. Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr, Sidney Crosby, and Evgeni Malkin have won the Hart Memorial Trophy while playing for the franchise.","  Hockey[edit] The NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins have played in Pittsburgh since the team's founding in 1967. The team has won 6 Eastern Conference titles (1991, 1992, 2008, 2009, 2016 and 2017) and 5 Stanley Cup championships (1991, 1992, 2009, 2016 and 2017). Since 1999, Hall of Famer and back-to-back playoff MVP Mario Lemieux has served as Penguins owner. Until moving into the PPG Paints Arena in 2010 (when it was known as Consol Energy Center), the team played their home games at the world's first retractable domed stadium, the Civic Arena, or in local parlance ""The Igloo"".[212] Ice hockey has had a regional fan base since the 1890s semi-pro Keystones. The city's first ice rink dates back to 1889, when there was an ice rink at the Casino in Schenley Park. From 1896 to 1956, the Exposition Building on the Allegheny River near The Point and Duquesne Gardens in Oakland offered indoor skating.[213] The NHL awarded one of its first franchises to the city in 1924 on the strength of the back-to-back USAHA championship-winning Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates made several Stanley Cup playoff runs before folding from Great Depression financial pressures. Hockey survived with the Pittsburgh Hornets farm team (1936–1967) and their seven finals appearances and three championships in 18 playoff seasons. Robert Morris University fields a Division I college hockey team at the Island Sports Center. Pittsburgh has semi-pro and amateur teams such as the Pittsburgh Penguins Elite.[214] Pro-grade ice rinks in the region include the Rostraver Ice Garden and Iceoplex at Southpointe."
What replaced the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility?," The UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, which includes a new team practice and training facility, replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility.","  The UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex under construction in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania, in April 2015. The complex opened in August 2015, and is used by the Penguins as their practice facility. From 1995 to 2015, the IceoPlex at Southpointe in the South Hills suburbs served as the team's practice facility. Robert Morris University's 84 Lumber Arena has served as a secondary practice facility for the team. During the franchise's first pre-season training camp and pre-season exhibition games, the Brantford Civic Centre in Brantford, Ontario, served as its home,[92] and by the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, the team was using the suburban Rostraver Ice Garden for training. In August 2015, the Penguins and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) opened the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, combining a new team practice and training facility with a UPMC Sports Medicine treatment and research complex, in suburban Cranberry Township near the interchange between Interstate 79 and Pennsylvania Route 228.[93] The twin rink facility replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility, freeing up the Consol Energy Center for other events on days the Penguins are not scheduled to play.[94] As with most other NHL arenas, the Penguins make use of a goal horn whenever the team scores a goal at home. It is also played just before the beginning of a home game, and after a Penguins victory. Their current goal horn made by Nathan Manufacturing, Inc. and introduced in 2005 to coincide with Sidney Crosby joining the team, was used at both the Civic Arena and the Consol Energy Center.[95][96]","  Skiing/skating[edit] Seven Springs Mountain Resort, Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, Wisp Ski Resort and Boyce Park offer skiing with both PPG Place and North Park offering ice skating.  In 2011, the Pittsburgh Penguins created a new public rink in the South Side neighborhood's Southside Works called ""Penguin Pond"".

The rich history of the city has shaped these neighborhoods into their own distinct personalities.  Mt. Washington has the view to beat all views. USA Weekend magazine named it one of the top 10 most beautiful views in the country. In the heart of it all, Downtown gives you your fill of city hustle and bustle, a 14-block Cultural District, public art, extraordinary dining and outdoor parks and plazas. Pittsburgh's neighborhoods are as wonderful and distinctive as its people and they're waiting to welcome you!","     Up for more walking? Make sure you include a visit to the Strip District where you’ll find a variety of shopping, including lots of black and gold merchandise, eclectic food and restaurant offerings and gift shops. Be on the lookout for The Strip Mural by artists Carley Parris and Shannon Pultz – it’s easily viewed on Penn Ave. For those wishing to savor all the flavors of the Strip District – or a handful of other Pittsburgh neighborhoods – consider booking a walking food tour with ‘Burgh Bits & Bites.     Sports fans are in luck in Pittsburgh! The city is home to several professional teams, including the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Penguins, and the locals are fanatical for their favorite sports teams. You can find a large area devoted to the teams at the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, located inside the Senator John Heinz History Museum.             The Heinz History Museum pays tribute to more than the local sports teams. Here, you can learn so much about one of Pittsburgh’s most famous citizens, Mister Rogers, a national treasure. Find his monogrammed house slippers and one of his beloved red cardigans. The museum also is full of American history following the democracy of the country."

","         Carmella's Plates & Pints There's plenty of reasons to love Carmella's on the South Side: a massive selection of bourbon and tequila, live music, Sunday brunch, and great food no matter when you visit.Their 2024 Summer Restaurant Week menu is absolutely mouthwatering and packed with fresh flavors perfect for the season. I'm already salivating for the elote pierogi filled with cotija cheese and potato and topped with a fire-grilled corn salsa and chipotle crema, and the jerked chicken served with rice and peas and crispy plantains is just what I'm craving. Add on a split banana for dessert (the og banana split was invented here, after all) and you have just made the perfect restaurant week meal.                 View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Carmella's Plates & Pints (@carmellasplatesandpints)                 Hofbrauhaus Clocking in at three courses and only $24.24, Hofbrauhaus in the South Side is one of the most affordable options on the list that packs big flavor into each bite. Begin with one of their signature German soft pretzels and homemade bier cheese, then chow down on a sampler of wursts or delicious fried jagerschnitzel before ending with a light and delicious Bavarian cream puff.Now that's a meal to jump up on the table and sing about! Plus, you'll have enough extra dough in your pocket to have a beer (or 4) to accompany this raucous dining experience.","

Signature Clayton Tour Experience: Gilded, Not Golden
Tours run Tuesdays through Sundays
About the Tour
Just announced! Gilded, Not Golden, the newly reinterpreted tour of Clayton, won a 2024 Leadership in History Award from the American Association for State and Local History.

Look beneath the “gilded” surface of the late 19th century to reveal the era's more complicated truths. Discover Pittsburgh’s influence as an industrial powerhouse through a shared dialogue about the ongoing legacies of the Gilded Age.
 
""The tour guide did an excellent job of explaining the house details, decorative arts, family history & Gilded Age, in general. I particularly liked how history of the working class was woven in as a counterpoint to the lavish lifestyle of the wealthy.""

- Claire L.


The Gilded Age was an era not only of immense wealth and progress, but also rapid industrialization, unprecedented immigration, and labor strife. Explore this pivotal time in our nation’s history at Clayton, the only remaining fully preserved Gilded Age mansion in Pittsburgh. Join your guide and other visitors for a conversational experience that shares the stories of the Frick family and other Pittsburghers, and considers how the legacy of the Gilded Age continues to affect us today.
 

Content advisory: 1892 was a tumultuous year for the Frick family and the Pittsburgh steel industry. For this reason, tours of Clayton deal with potentially challenging subject matter, including discussions of violence, grief, and child loss.

What is the purpose of the Operating Budget according to the provided text?,"
            
            The Operating Budget is a financial plan that outlines the expected revenues and expenditures of an organization, in this case, the City of Pittsburgh, for a specific fiscal year. It serves as a tool for managing resources, making informed decisions, and ensuring accountability and transparency in the use of public funds.","What is the Operating Budget? The Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year. Reported within this document are  figures related to planned expenditures and projected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year. Expenditures are  spread across all City Departments, Bureaus, and Elected Offices. These expenditures represent costs for the  administration and distribution of governmental services. These services include, but are not limited to: public  safety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and  programming for local parks and community recreation centers. In addition, the General Fund also supports the  routine administration of local government that includes employee wages and health benefits, workers’  compensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service. The City collects revenues to finance the costs associated with delivering services to residents. Revenues are  collected by the City from the levy of taxes, collection of fees related to the issuance of permits and licenses,  charges for services provided by City Departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other  revenue generating mechanisms.  The Operating Budget combines information relating to expenditures and revenues, creating a plan as to what  governmental services can be executed by the City and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal  year. The detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in  delivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed. The Operating Budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the Mayor and  Members of City Council. Laws established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict how much money the  City of Pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses. As a result, the City of  Pittsburgh must balance the demands for services against the available resources that it can legally acquire  through tax and non-tax revenue generating mechanisms. Given the reality of scarce resources, the City must  prioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the  City. The level of funding allocated to individual Departments and programs within the City clearly exhibits  priorities set by the City’s elected public officials. Finally, the Operating Budget can be viewed as a legally binding document. All of the costs incurred by the City of  Pittsburgh in providing day-to-day public services must be paid for out of the Operating Budget. Therefore, the  City of Pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document. The Operating  Budget can only be altered through a series of formal processes, which parallel those enacted in the initial  creation of the plan. Basis of Accounting The General Fund budget is adopted on a cash basis of accounting, meaning that the City of Pittsburgh  recognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid. The Fiscal Year The City of Pittsburgh’s fiscal year begins on the first day of January and ends on the last day of December of  each year. This can only be changed by ordinance. Balanced Budget Mandate The City’s Home Rule Charter requires that the annual Operating Budget be balanced, with estimated revenues  equal to or greater than estimated expenditures. Should revenues exceed expenditures at the end of a fiscal year,  the budget surplus is transferred into the City’s reserve fund balance.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide 20","How to Read the Budget Throughout this budget document, financial data is illustrated in a variety of ways. In general, each separate  section of the document reports the same financial data. The level of detail is the only substantial difference  between each report within a section.  Departmental Sections The most detailed and specific illustration of the General Fund Operating Budget financial data can be found in  the Departmental Sections of the document. This section details funds by subclass and account that have been  appropriated to each individual division. The following are the different components that in aggregate make up the  Departmental Sections of the Operating Budget. City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide 28","Organization Chart The organization chart is a visual depiction of the functional areas within each City Department, Agency, Bureau,  or Elected Office that are responsible for the execution of services and programs. The chart is very general; with  the exception of directors or other managers, the chart does not identify individual positions. Departmental Overview At the beginning of each departmental section, readers will find a Mission Statement which defines the  organization. The Mission Statement is followed by an overview that provides a detailed description of the  department. This section of the narrative describes different functional areas within each Department, Agency,  Bureau, or Elected Office and their associated services or programs. Current year accomplishments are listed. Position Summary The position summary lists all of the budgeted jobs within the organization. The full-time equivalent, or “FTE,”  represents the number of full-time workers in the position. The “Rate/Grade” category indicates how an  employee’s pay level is calculated. Grade and step plans for non-union employees and AFSCME 2719 employees  can be found as an appendix to this document. For full time positions, a “12” in the “Hours/Months” column  indicates that the position is budgeted for all 12 months in the year. Smaller numbers indicate a position starting or  ending mid-year. For part time positions, the number in this column represents budgeted hours of work. The  “Budget” column highlights the total amount, in dollars, that is allocated to pay all personnel in that position. The  “Vacancy Allowance” adjusts the subclass expenditures to account for savings associated with vacant positions  throughout the year. A summary from 2023 is also included to facilitate comparisons. Subclass Detail This portion of the departmental budget includes 2022 actual expenditures and budget numbers at the subclass  and object account level. For example, the general “Professional and Technical Services” subclass will highlight  the appropriation amounts for specific accounts, such as “Administrative Fees,” “Workforce Training,” and  “Computer Maintenance.” Readers can easily compare budgeted expenditures from 2023 with budgeted  expenditures for 2024. The final columns shows the difference and percent difference between the 2023 and 2024  budgeted amounts. Under the Personnel – Salaries & Wages subclass, there are several important details. Regular  salary represents  the total base pay for the organization. Longevity  pay is awarded to employees in certain collective bargaining  agreements based on seniority and tenure. Salary allowances  are used to pay for part-time, temporary, or  seasonal workers, as well as student interns. When uniform  allowances are paid directly to employees, their costs  are listed accordingly. Leave Buyback  represents sick leave hours that can be “sold back” to the City. Premium  Pay appropriations compensate for overtime hours. Reimbursements  are funds from outside sources that are  used to offset certain position expenses. Five-Year Forecasts Finally, the five-year forecast allows readers to consider what the City expects to spend in the future. In addition to  the 2024 budget, there are projections for 2025 through 2028. The percent change from the prior year is included  as a reference point. Note for Fund Accounts For special revenue accounts that are included in the Operating Budget, the Fiscal Year 2024 summary is  composed of the “Projected Beginning Balance” for January 1, 2024, anticipated revenues and expenditures, and  the “Projected Ending Balance” for December 31, 2024. These funds carry over from year to year. A position  summary follows when appropriate.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide 29","The City utilizes a hierarchical chart of accounts to distribute funds to each Department, Bureau, Agency, and  Elected Office. These accounts are organized by levels of detail, with the individual object accounts being the  most specific:  Fund ...Cost Center ...Subclass ...Object Account The legal appropriations in the Operating Budget refer to the General Fund, which is coded as 11101.

Five-Year Expenditure Forecast The 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan submitted by the City highlights the Mayor's commitment to  financial sustainability, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations, and strengthening  financial management practices. The City plans to achieve these by: • Eliminating operating deficits in the baseline financial projections while preserving core municipal services • Managing the City’s debt burden to provide more resources to support daily operations • Keeping the City’s fund balance at an appropriate level to avoid the need for cash flow borrowings and  provide an adequate buffer against unanticipated revenue shortfalls or expenditure increases • Maintaining the City’s pension fund contributions at levels recommended by its actuary The 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan provides a fiscally responsible path to address legacy costs and  improve the City’s long-term fiscal health by: • Allocating an additional $243 million to the pension fund over five years beyond the state mandated  minimum municipal obligation (MMO) to reach the actuarial recommended contribution (ARC) • Continuing efforts of responsible borrowing with the City’s debt burden totaling 10.1 percent of General  Fund expenditures in 2024 • Allocating a $22.0 million in ""pay-as-you-go"" (PAYGO) transfer to the capital improvement plan In addition to the information outlined in the revenue and expenditure sections of the budget document, key  components and assumptions incorporated into the forecast include the following: • Salaries & Wages: OMB will continue to work with departments to identify opportunities to increase  workplace productivity and implement other operational efficiencies as part of the enterprise cost  management initiative. • Employee Benefits: This category includes all health care costs for both active and retired employees,  workers' compensation costs, employer mandated costs such as social security, and employer  contributions to the pension fund. Health care costs are projected to rise over the course of the next few  years, but the City is working to improve its overall wellness program with the goal of improving employee City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget  Fiscal Year 2024 Expenditures 53"

","         Carmella's Plates & Pints There's plenty of reasons to love Carmella's on the South Side: a massive selection of bourbon and tequila, live music, Sunday brunch, and great food no matter when you visit.Their 2024 Summer Restaurant Week menu is absolutely mouthwatering and packed with fresh flavors perfect for the season. I'm already salivating for the elote pierogi filled with cotija cheese and potato and topped with a fire-grilled corn salsa and chipotle crema, and the jerked chicken served with rice and peas and crispy plantains is just what I'm craving. Add on a split banana for dessert (the og banana split was invented here, after all) and you have just made the perfect restaurant week meal.                 View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Carmella's Plates & Pints (@carmellasplatesandpints)                 Hofbrauhaus Clocking in at three courses and only $24.24, Hofbrauhaus in the South Side is one of the most affordable options on the list that packs big flavor into each bite. Begin with one of their signature German soft pretzels and homemade bier cheese, then chow down on a sampler of wursts or delicious fried jagerschnitzel before ending with a light and delicious Bavarian cream puff.Now that's a meal to jump up on the table and sing about! Plus, you'll have enough extra dough in your pocket to have a beer (or 4) to accompany this raucous dining experience.","

            One of the most distinctive features of the Mattress Factory is its collection of large-scale installations, which are housed in the museum's historic buildings, as well as in its contemporary galleries. These installations range from immersive and interactive environments that invite visitors to explore and engage with the art, to more contemplative and introspective works that challenge viewers to reflect on their own experiences and perspectives.
            
            In addition to its large-scale installations, the Mattress Factory also features a diverse and dynamic program of temporary exhibitions, which are curated by both the museum's own curatorial team, as well as by guest curators from around the world. These exhibitions span a wide range of media and artistic practices, including painting, sculpture, photography, video art, installation art, performance art, and more.
            
            Another important aspect of the Mattress Factory's programming is its commitment to engaging with and promoting the work of emerging and underrepresented artists. To this end, the museum offers a range of opportunities for artists at various stages of their careers, including residency programs, exhibition opportunities, artist talks and workshops, and more.

What is the webpage primarily about?,"

            The context provided does not contain sufficient information to determine the primary topic of a webpage. To accurately answer this question, one would need to examine the content and structure of the webpage in question.","  A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things. HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.","CMU Event: Libraries Workshop: Creating Websites and Portfolios with GitPages

What affordable meal option is offered at Lucy's Banh Mi?,"

            The signature banh mi at Lucy's is only $8, making it an affordable meal option.","      Market Street Grocery  435 Market St, Pittsburgh, PA 15222 This local grocer has both hot food and a deli. Their lunches are far from bland and they have different hot and ready to serve lunches daily. Grab a meal or a sandwich with homemade soup and hang out in the grocery's quaint aesthetic. $10 or under choice: Cup of daily homemade soup and a half of a sandwich.              Lucy's Banh Mi  2216 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15222 There's no website, just a small sign of today's specials outside of this street food vendor you can walk right by in the Strip District. However, Lucy's is perhaps my favorite hidden gem in this area with a deliciously seasoned sandwich piled with her signature sauce, cilantro, jalapeno and shredded carrots for the perfect bite. $10 or under choice: The signature banh mi here is only $8 and a meal in itself.",                         Lucy's Bánh Mì How to Find: Strip DistrictIYKYK. Pittsburghers flock to Lucy's daily for one of the best bites in the city for lunch. The perfectly crisped bread and the crunch of the pickled veggies on top and a sweet sauce to tie it all together makes this a must-stop every time I'm in the Strip.,"              View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Jimmy and Nino Sunseris (@jimmyandnino_sunseris)       The Freshest Sushi If you see a line running outside the door at Wholey's, get in it. That's the queue for Andy's Sushi Bar, serving up some of the freshest sashimi, nigiri and maki in the Burgh for more than 25 years. Snag the Wholey and Andy's Special rolls and you'll know in one bite what makes this place so special.              View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Sammie Eats (@sammie_eatz)       Street Food Worth a Stop Still hungry? Me too. As you walk by Bar Marco, seek out Lucy's Bánh Mì. No, there's no restaurant (or even a sign), just Lucy, her grill and some condiments under a small tent as she serves up some of the best sandwiches in the Burgh. Bring cash; this is the best $8 you're going to spend in the city.","             Sunseri's  1901 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15222 If you miss Lucy's, head into the deli at Sunseri's in the Strip instead! The pepperoni rolls here reign supreme and every sandwich here is cheap enough that you can add a cannoli and still stay under budget. $10 or under choice: Atomic pepperoni roll or the eggplant parm sandwich             Everyday Noodles  5875 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15217 I can safely recommend Everyday Noodles for lunch because everything on this menu is so good, you'll be back for dinner to try the rest. Watch the noodles or dim sum you're about to order be made right in front of you, seasoned and cooked to perfection and enjoyed all in a quick lunch break. $10 or under choice: Dan Dan Noodles or pork vegetable potstickers. Come back for dinner for the steamed dumplings, also made fresh in-house.","

The 2025 History Maker Honorees will be announced soon – check this space for updates!

The 32nd annual History Makers Award Dinner, presented by BNY, will take place on Thursday, June 5, at the Heinz History Center.



Since 1992, the Heinz History Center has honored exceptional individuals whose accomplishments, while rooted here in Western Pa., transcend geographic bounds. History Makers profoundly contribute to the innovative history and collective heritage of our region and represent a commitment to excellence that has defined our community. The History Center is proud to celebrate such individuals and to share their remarkable stories.

Funding raised from the Award Dinner helps to preserve our regional history for future generations and provide a space where experiences and learning moments for all ages help make memories that last a lifetime. The History Center tells the stories of Western Pennsylvanians whose hard work, innovation, enterprise, creativity, and courage improved the world and still serves to guide and inspire us today. Like our History Makers, we are encouraged (but not surprised) by stories of Pittsburgh’s can-do spirit and kindness. After all—we are home to “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.”

The Stories We Keep

The Stories We Keep: Conserving Objects from Ancient Egypt
Open through Summer 2025

Every Egyptian object in the museum’s care has stories to tell, about its creation and original use, its journey to Pittsburgh, and about the lives of those in ancient Egypt. The Stories We Keep features more than 80 ancient items—including the 4,000-year-old Dahshur boat, one of only four in the world. Engage with these objects like never before, have conversations with museum conservators, observe the care and restoration of objects in real time, and attempt the work yourself by reassembling replicas of ancient artifacts.

The Stories We Keep invites visitors to see these objects—cared for by the Museum for more than a century—in a new light and to witness the work that will preserve them for future generations.

Learn more about conservation of ancient Egyptian artifacts.

PBF invites girls between 15 and 18 years old to jumpstart their career as firefighters and community leaders by learning alongside experienced women in the field.

Participants will get a well-rounded, real-life look at what it takes to become a firefighter while learning about topics that will fuel empowerment such as fitness and nutrition, emergency medical care, fire science leadership and self-confidence.  “Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire recognized the need to close the gender gap that currently exists by confronting gender stereotypes and encouraging women to seek out the fire service as a viable career option. Firefighters engage with the entire community, so bringing in people of different backgrounds, genders and perspectives enhances our department's ability to better service our city,” said Fire Inspector and Fire Prevention Officer Lisa Epps-Cuda.  “Our hope is that this camp’s focus on encouraging and empowering young women reflects an effort to change a profession in which women are under-represented. We aim to shift the existing trend from traditional “boys’ club” to one that is inclusive to women and minorities.”  The application deadline is August 8, 2022.

The 31 recruits, including one woman, began their 32 weeks of training on April 18. During the ceremony, IAFF Local No.1 President Ralph Sicuro told the recruits and their families that over his 25 years of service with the Bureau he has witnessed tremendous improvements to training, tactics, and the equipment that firefighters use.   “To my newest brothers and sister, you have all received the best training there is to offer. You have developed the necessary skills to enter the field, but now you must hone those skills with experience,” said Sicuro.    Fire Chief Darryl Jones reminded the group that on day one of their training he told them that 100% effort was not enough, and that today he was proud to say they had met that challenge. “Your sleeves are no longer slick. You now carry the symbol of excellence in the fire service on your left sleeve. You have a responsibility to support the values represented by that shield. Remember what it stands for. Remember who and what it represents. Remember those who have come before you, those who have sacrificed, those who gave all. Please don’t let them down. You are now part of something very, very special,” said Jones. Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt administered the Oath of Office and told the new firefighters that they would experience challenges and trauma on the job that would require them to take care of themselves and their colleagues. “Remember to keep yourselves physically and mentally ready. You have a whole group of people, of folks you’ve not only gone through the academy with, but now a much larger family of those who have gone through this before and have done what you're doing. If you need to talk, talk. If something is bothering you, don’t hold it in. Talk about it. They’ve been there, they’ve experienced it,” said Schmidt. Battalion Chief Michael F. Riley presented two recruits with awards earned during their eight months of training. Eric Darr received the Academic Achievement Award and James Ross earned the Physical Fitness Award. The recruits will be assigned to their respective stations to officially begin their tenure with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire on Monday, December 5. Congratulations Firefighters!         "
What significant event led to the establishment of Carnegie Mellon University?,"

            The merger of Carnegie Tech and the Mellon Institute in 1967 led to the establishment of Carnegie Mellon University. This merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons, allowing Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences.","         Carnegie Mellon University   In 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as Carnegie Mellon University. The merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons. It allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. In 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech-Mellon Institute merger, revisiting the shared vision of the founders and recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery.","             Education's Role in Pittsburgh's Technology Scene  Carnegie Mellon University: Home to the first emoticon in 1982, CMU is recognized as one of the first computer science programs in the world and continues to rank as one of the top. The university is known to collaborate with companies such as Apple, Intel, Caterpillar and Disney, helping to expand technology ties in Pittsburgh. Carnegie Mellon University has page after page of robots they've created, too. University of Pittsburgh: Established in 2013, the University of Pittsburgh launched the Innovation Institute, a hub innovation and entrepreneurship. The Innovation Institute provides various services for Pitt Innovators including protecting intellectual property, commercializing new discoveries, educational programming and mentoring, and more.","  It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th century campus designed in the beaux arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories — the hands-on center of learning that persists today. It pioneered conservatory degree programs in music and drama, in addition to visual art and design programs. The first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech. It began offering graduate degrees. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China. It laid the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. It initiated the 'Carnegie Plan' in 1938, a new curriculum that required science and engineer students to take courses in humanities and social sciences in order to better understand the needs of society. Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him.","      History -     CMU - Carnegie Mellon University                              Carnegie Mellon University ———     Search   Search        CMU                                       ›              About                                                        ›              History                                                Andrew Carnegie   A self-educated ""working boy"" who loved books, Andrew Carnegie emigrated from Scotland in 1848 and settled in Pittsburgh, Pa.

He rose to prominence by founding what became the world's largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century.","       A Global Impact   In its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research. A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe — from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists. In the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh. Today its global presence includes campuses in Qatar and Silicon Valley, Calif., more than a dozen degree-granting locations and more than 20 research partnerships such as Los Angeles; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Australia; China; Portugal and Rwanda."
"What changes are being implemented to traffic flow on East Carson Street beginning August 12, 2021?","

            Due to a partial building collapse in the 1600 block of E. Carson Street on August 12, 2021, Public Safety is temporarily halting its traffic calming pilot project. The upper level of a two-story building sustained severe damage during heavy rainstorms and engineers are concerned the integrity of the structure, and that of the adjacent buildings, may be compromised. As such, Public Safety will be closing E. Carson Street between S.16th and S.17th streets to begin the demolition of 1604 E. Carson. A large crane has been staged in the street to begin that process. During this time, traffic will be diverted around this block. Tractor trailers and longer industrial-type vehicles will need to divert via the 10th Street Bridge or the Birmingham Bridge. As stated earlier, the traffic pilot project implemented on July 30 will NOT be in place for the time being. Some businesses on this block will be impacted during the demolition. There is no timeline for its completion. This is an evolving situation and Public Safety will provide information to the public as it becomes available. 

            Public Safety would like to thank residents, business owners, and visitors to Pittsburgh for their patience and understanding with these last minute changes and the inconvenience they may cause.",  13/8/2021 15:34:21   East Carson Street Fully Reopens to Vehicle Traffic Following Building Collapse,"  20/8/2021 15:35:36   Public Safety to Reinstate Modified Traffic Pilot Project on the South Side  PITTSBURGH, PA, (August 25, 2021) – After a temporary delay due to a partial building collapse in the 1600 block of E. Carson St. on August 12, the Department of Public Safety is reestablishing its modified traffic pilot project on the South Side this upcoming weekend, August 27 – August 29. The primary intent of the plan has been to stem the flow of vehicle traffic into the commercial corridor to alleviate some of the density in the area during the busiest evening hours on the weekends.  Ongoing discussion with business owners and residents has resulted in slight adjustments to the plan to ensure ease of access to restaurants and retail stores in the early evening hours.   Public Safety has made modifications to the times of day during which the measures will be implemented.  Beginning at 9:30 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, East Carson Street will convert from two-way to one-way traffic traveling eastbound (outbound) between S. 10th and S. 18th. The previous start time was 7:00 p.m.    On Fridays and Saturdays, 'No Parking' measures will be strictly enforced on these blocks of East Carson Street starting at 8 p.m., including the towing of vehicles, to keep this stretch clear for Public Safety vehicle access. Signage along East Carson will be clearly marked to reflect the altered parking hours for these days.  Side streets from S.11th to S.17th will remain open to through-traffic until 9:30 p.m., at which time vehicles will be diverted around those streets via either Muriel Street or Sarah Street. In previous weeks, the side streets were closed at 7:00 p.m.  The pilot project on the South Side will remain in effect for the near future and Public Safety will continue to monitor its impact and effectiveness.   ","   PITTSBURGH, PA (July 28, 2021) – The Department of Public Safety, in coordination with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), is announcing adjustments to traffic patterns in the busy South Side business corridor on weekend evenings. As pandemic restrictions have eased, the increased volume of visitors to East Carson Street has created serious concerns such as increased gun violence, overcrowded sidewalks and streets, traffic safety obstacles, and noise complaints. In response, the City of Pittsburgh Public Safety is implementing the following changes as a pilot project: - Between the hours of 7 p.m. until 4 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, vehicle traffic will be allowed OUTBOUND ONLY on E. Carson Street between S.10th and S.18th Streets. - Side streets from S.11th to S.17th inclusive will be closed to traffic. Vehicles will be diverted around those streets via either Muriel Street or Sarah Street. Only valid residential permit holders will be allowed to enter these areas  - Only emergency vehicles and Port Authority buses will be allowed to travel in both directions on E. Carson - Ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft will not be permitted on East Carson Street between S.10th and S.18th Streets. Passengers must arrange pick-up and drop-off points in advance, utilizing one of the open side streets - Parking and deliveries will be prohibited on either side of E. Carson Street between 7 p.m. and 4 a.m. - Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers will be posted in key areas to ensure the safe flow of traffic - During this pilot period, PennDOT is working closely with the City of Pittsburgh to halt overnight work in connection with its East Carson Street Improvement Project These changes will be in place for the foreseeable future in an effort to mitigate gridlock, allow for a dedicated emergency vehicle corridor, and create a safer, more pleasant experience for residents and visitors to the South Side. “Public Safety recognizes that these traffic shifts will be an adjustment to those who live in or frequent the South Side. Our personnel will be working closely with businesses and community groups to ensure a seamless transition. We appreciate everyone’s cooperation and patience during this time,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich.","   29/9/2021 13:58:11   Public Safety to Reinstate Two-Way Traffic on East Carson Street  PITTSBURGH, PA, (September 30, 2021) – In the last week of July, Public Safety introduced a traffic pilot project in the busy South Side corridor in an effort to ease vehicle congestion, improve pedestrian safety, and mitigate an increase in violence in the area on weekend evenings. Thanks to the cooperation and patience of businesses and residents in the area, Public Safety is satisfied that these measures have resulted in several positive improvements.  As a result, beginning on Friday, October 1, 2021, traffic on East Carson Street will convert back to two-way traffic between S.10th and S.18th Streets in the evenings.   On Fridays and Saturdays, 'No Parking' measures will still be strictly enforced on these blocks of East Carson Street starting at 8 p.m., including the towing of vehicles, to keep this stretch of road clear for Public Safety vehicle access.  In addition to the traffic pattern shifts implemented in July, Pittsburgh Police increased the number of officers in the area and expanded enforcement. Over the past four weekends, Police working in the South Side corridor have made 12 arrests, one firearms-related arrest, one firearm seizure, issued 371 citations, and towed 69 vehicles. These enhanced enforcement measures will remain in place. “The Department of Public Safety is pleased with the progress that has been made to increase safety on the South Side. As promised, we engaged in regular discussions with residents and businesses during this time to share ideas on the impact and effectiveness of the pilot program and the stepped-up enforcement. We thank everyone for their patience and participation in this effort. It wasn't always easy to balance competing needs, but we are grateful for the partnerships that helped make this happen,"" said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. Public Safety will continue to monitor the South Side in the interest of keeping residents and visitors safe while they enjoy the many benefits this unique district has to offer. ","  PITTSBURGH, PA, (August 13, 2021) -- Due to a partial building collapse in the 1600 block of E. Carson Street last night, Public Safety is temporarily halting its traffic calming pilot project. The upper level of a two-story building sustained severe damage during heavy rainstorms and engineers are concerned the integrity of the structure, and that of the adjacent buildings, may be compromised. As such, Public Safety will be closing E. Carson Street between S.16th and S.17th streets to begin the demolition of 1604 E. Carson. A large crane has been staged in the street to begin that process. During this time, traffic will be diverted around this block. Tractor trailers and longer industrial-type vehicles will need to divert via the 10th Street Bridge or the Birmingham Bridge. As stated earlier, the traffic pilot project implemented on July 30 will NOT be in place for the time being.  Some businesses on this block will be impacted during the demolition. There is no timeline for its completion. This is an evolving situation and Public Safety will provide information to the public as it becomes available.  Public Safety would like to thank residents, business owners, and visitors to Pittsburgh for their patience and understanding with these last minute changes and the inconvenience they may cause.  "

Pittsburgh's history, from military outpost to industrial giant, shows in many of its historic structures. The three rivers and rolling hills provide a beautiful backdrop to the work of such architects as Frank Lloyd Wright, Henry Hobson Richardson and Philip Johnson. Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture dots the surrounding area and is a must-see. Fallingwater, a feat of architectural genius, is right in Pittsburgh's backyard. Fallingwater is just one of several Frank lloyd Wright works named to the UNESCO World Heritage list.

            The unidentified body was recovered by River Rescue on May 5, 2018, from the Monongahela River near the 10th Street Bridge in Pittsburgh.","   4/5/2018 17:10:11   UPDATE: Body Pulled From River  (Pittsburgh, Pa.) May 5, 2018 -- River Rescue pulled an unidentified body from the Monongahela River around 12:30 p.m. Saturday. Boaters reported seeing the body near the 10th Street Bridge. Police are investigating. UPDATE: Body is an African-American male. Age and identity unknown.","  9/5/2018 02:42:49   BODY FOUND IN THE MONONGAHELA RIVER  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  PITTSBURGH, PA (May 10, 2018) - On Thursday, May 10, 2018 at approximately 11:14 a.m., Pittsburgh River Rescue along with Police Detectives were dispatched to the South Side Flats for a report of a body found floating in the Monongahela River.  River Rescue crews retrieved the body of an unidentified male from the Mon river behind the 3700 block of S. Water Street. Homicide and Crime Lab detectives combed the riverbank and the trail area collecting information. The body was later taken to the Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office.

With 265 calls for service on the region’s rivers in 2020, River Rescue’s life-saving reach will expand even further with the new boat’s state-of-the-art capabilities. “The advanced technology that the newest of the city’s River Rescue craft provides will give police officers and EMS personnel the best chance of helping anyone who experiences an emergency on our three rivers. Special thanks to Mayor Peduto, Council, the city’s Equipment Leasing Authority, and the dedicated group of police officers and paramedic/divers for their work over the past 18 months to make this day a reality,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. Manufactured by Lake Assault in Superior, Wisconsin, the new boat will become the primary rescue vessel for River Rescue, in addition to the Sea Ark boat that is currently in service. It’s equipped with two V8 Yamaha 425 outboard motors, as well as several new or enhanced features such as: increased fire suppression capabilities, improved lighting, a windless anchor, docking assist for intricate maneuvering, and built-in sonar to provide more accurate search capability on the water. Inside the cabin, forward and backward-trained cameras allow the operator to be more aware of what is happening on the deck and around the boat while maintaining navigation on the water. From EMS Division Chief Richard Linn, Operations Chief for River Rescue, ""Pittsburgh River Rescue is comprised of men and women from the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services and the Bureau of Police who have received extensive training to keep everyone safe on our three rivers. This boat was designed by these professionals."" Some other key features include a bow gate which can be lowered to allow for more accessible shoreline work, such as loading and unloading equipment or personnel and built-in, improved FLIR (Forward-Looking Infrared) for full night vision. The boat’s catamaran hull also provides more stability on the water. ""Our three rivers are one of the defining assets of the City of Pittsburgh. We are proud of our River Rescue team that brings together experts from the EMS and Police bureaus to ensure safety on our rivers is a priority. This team have been leaders throughout the state in setting standards for river safety and rescue and now they have a state-of-the-art boat equipped with the latest technologies to respond to all emergencies,"" said Mayor William Peduto.        ","  15/5/2018 10:32:15   River Rescue Saves Lost Gosling     (Pittsburgh, Pa.) May 16, 2018 – The City of Pittsburgh's River Rescue patrol and Police Chief Scott Schubert found and cared for a lost gosling that climbed into a rescue boat on Tuesday. Paramedic Dave Naples found the gosling Tuesday night around 6:30 p.m. as crews were preparing to patrol the Ohio River during an outdoor concert by ""American Idol"" finalist Gabby Barrett at the Rivers Casino Amphitheater. Naples found the gosling, believed to be one- or two- weeks old, covered in debris and shaking in the transom well near the rear motors. Due to recent rainfall, the city's rivers are moving quickly and carrying debris, which results in challenging conditions for goslings. The River Rescue crew built a makeshift nest for the gosling by laying towels in a plastic bin. The gosling “cleaned itself off and was then full of vim and vigor,” Naples said.        They named it Gabby because “if it weren’t for the concert, we might not have been patrolling and the gosling probably wouldn’t have made it,” Chief Schubert said. The crew called the Pennsylvania Game Commission, then cared for the gosling overnight. State Game Warden Thomas Kline took the gosling to the Humane Animal Rescue Wildlife Center in Verona around  12 p.m. Wednesday. Kline said anyone who finds a solo gosling should call the Game Commission at (724) 238-9523. River Rescue is a partnership between Pittsburgh Police and the Emergency Medical Services SCUBA search and rescue team. River Rescue responsibilities include piloting all river rescue vessels, enforcing commonwealth laws, patrolling area rivers and ports, and preventing, responding to and mitigating all waterborne emergencies.

What actions will Pittsburgh Public Safety take to ensure safety during First Night 2020?,"

            Pittsburgh Public Safety will take several measures to ensure safety during First Night 2020. Some of these measures include:

            1. Increased police presence throughout the city, with a focus on areas hosting events.

            2. Use of ShotSpotter technology to monitor and respond to gunfire incidents in real-time.

            3. Implementation of strict fireworks regulations, including a ban on all fireworks within 150 feet of any structure.

            4. Encouragement of responsible drinking practices, with a focus on designated drivers, public transportation, and ride-sharing services.

            By taking these measures, Pittsburgh Public Safety aims to ensure a safe and enjoyable First Night experience for all residents and visitors in the city.","  13/12/2019 14:36:11   Public Safety Statement on First Night 2020  PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 26, 2019) – A Pittsburgh tradition will continue Tuesday, Dec. 31 when the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust hosts “First Night 2020” events at venues throughout Downtown. First Night events always attract large crowds to the Golden Triangle. As such, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich reminds everyone to have fun, but also to be safe and law-abiding. “By working with our partners at the Cultural Trust, the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership and regional law enforcement departments, Pittsburgh Public Safety will be there to assure a safe experience for all,” Hissrich said. “First Night is a special night in Pittsburgh. We’re going to keep it that way. Anyone interested in engaging in illegal activities is advised to just stay home.” Hissrich warned against an unsafe New Year’s Eve tradition in many large cities: Shooting guns into the air. What goes up must come down, and the results are tragic when people are hit by celebratory gunfire. Police will observe ShotSpotter activations throughout the city and officers will arrest anyone caught discharging a firearm in public. Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will work with partnering law enforcement agencies -- including the Pennsylvania State Police, State Park Rangers, Port Authority Police, the Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office and the Allegheny County Police -- to provide uniformed and plainclothes officers throughout First Night venues. The Mounted Unit and River Rescue also will be present. Police urge people to never drink and drive. Officers will be actively looking for impaired drivers. As a reminder, city law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of a structure.

As is the case every year, the celebration will bring large crowds throughout the Downtown area. Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich welcomes the holiday season revelers, and urges everyone to be safe, respectful and law-abiding. “First Night is a Pittsburgh tradition and Public Safety will be there to assure a safe experience for all,” Hissrich said. “We ask that people behave responsibly and safely. As with other large events Downtown and elsewhere in the city, there will be a significant police presence to maintain safety.” New Year’s Eve is traditionally a time when people celebrate with alcohol. Public Safety urges people not to drink and drive. Police will be actively looking for impaired drivers and arresting those who break the law. Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will work with partnering law enforcement agencies -- including the Pennsylvania State Police, State Park Rangers, Port Authority Police and the Allegheny County Police -- to provide uniformed and plainclothes officers throughout the venues. The Mounted Unit also will be on hand. Public Safety reminds the public that drones are not allowed, nor are illegal weapons. City law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of a structure. The weather forecast calls for mild temperatures, but rain during the day. Please dress appropriately. In addition, Public Safety reminds residents that celebratory gunfire remains a significant problem in many cities, particularly on New Year’s Eve. Sadly, the results are often tragic when innocent people are hit by the bullets. Any bullet discharged from a gun, even into the sky, must land somewhere, and when it does, there is significant risk of injury or death. Pittsburgh Public Safety is committed to a policy of zero tolerance of illegal gun use. Our mission is to protect the quality of life for all residents throughout our community by creating an environment of enhanced safety and security. Officers will respond to all ShotSpotter activations throughout the city and will arrest anyone caught discharging a firearm in public. As normal, officers will be deployed throughout the city to maintain the peace, prevent crime and violence, and arrest drunk drivers. Pittsburgh Public Safety utilizes the ShotSpotter gunfire alerts and analysis solution to detect and locate gunfire incidents and gather gunfire intelligence and data to fight crime and violence. ShotSpotter provides precision-policing solutions for law enforcement to help deter gun violence and make cities, campuses and facilities safer. ShotSpotter is used in more than 90 cities. ShotSpotter uses a wide-area network of acoustic sensors to detect when a gun is fired, and then precisely and quickly pinpoints the location of the gunfire. ShotSpotter is one of several cutting-edge technologies the City of Pittsburgh employs to ensure the safety and security of our residents and officers. “Sometimes you’ll get a call that there’s shots fired, but you don’t know where it’s at in that area,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “Now it’s more specific where it’s at, how many rounds are being fired and, tactically for the officer approaching the scene, it’s safer.” For more information on First Night celebrations, go to firstnightpgh.trustarts.org.  ","   31/10/2022 18:31:19   Public Safety Prepares for Crowds to Welcome 2023 on First Night  PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 30, 2022) – As 2022 comes to a close, Pittsburgh locals and visitors will gather together downtown for Pittsburgh’s annual “First Night”  to welcome 2023.  Traditionally, Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Highmark First Night Pittsburgh celebrations draw tens of thousands of people to the city. This is the 29th year for the event.  “First Night is a longstanding tradition for downtown and the many people who choose to come to Pittsburgh to kick off the New Year,” said Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt. “We work very hard to make the night not only safe, but fun and memorable for everyone who chooses to celebrate with us in our city.” Members of the Pittsburgh Police and Public Safety will be on-hand to help everyone celebrate in a safe environment. Officers will be visible in the Cultural District and other areas hosting events throughout the evening.  “Our officers are here to engage with people during the festivities not only as police officers, but as members of the community,” said PBP Acting Police Chief Thomas Stangrecki. “However, we always ask the public to help us keep everyone safe, as well. If you see something, say something.” As a reminder, Police urge people to never drink and drive. Use public transportation or Uber, Lyft and designated drivers. Police will actively be looking for impaired drivers throughout the night.

Dec. 31 traditionally draws tens of thousands of people to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Highmark First Night Pittsburgh celebrations at venues throughout Downtown. Last year, those crowds stayed home due to pandemic concerns, but this year organizers are adapting the event again by moving much of it outdoors.  Of course, COVID-19 is still at the forefront of many minds, given the emergence of the Omicron variant. This year, there are some new requirements to keep crowds safe. Proof of vaccination, a valid ID and a mask are required for admission at any indoor venue.  “There are ways to both stay safe and have fun,” said Medical Director for the City of Pittsburgh Dr. Ronald Roth. “Even if you are fully vaccinated, wear a proper mask when inside or outside if you will be within close proximity of others from outside your own household.”  Further, a proper fitting, three-layer surgical-type mask is a better choice than a cloth mask. As always, proper social distancing is suggested where possible.  First Night is a long-standing family-friendly tradition and members of the Pittsburgh Police and Public Safety will be on-hand to help ensure residents and visitors are able to celebrate in a safe environment.  “As always, we encourage people to celebrate responsibly,” said PBP Police Chief Scott Schubert. “Public Safety officials will be highly visible and we encourage participants to engage with our personnel if they are in need of assistance or directions. Safety is everyone’s responsibility, so if you see something, say something!”  As a reminder, Police urge people to never drink and drive. Use public transportation or Uber, Lyft and designated drivers. Police will actively be looking for impaired drivers throughout the night.

Dec. 31 is traditionally a night that draws tens of thousands of people to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Highmark First Night Pittsburgh celebrations at venues throughout Downtown.  Not this year. Due to the pandemic, venues are closed, large gatherings are prohibited, fireworks have been cancelled and First Night has transformed into a made-for-TV-only event.  “I know that we all want—and absolutely deserve—to celebrate New Year’s Eve as we always do: With family and friends, with fireworks and with fanfare,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “That’s just not possible or responsible this year. Better times are certainly ahead, but we must maintain our resolve now in order to see this pandemic through to the end.”  Hissrich re-issued his traditional New Year’s Eve message, with a caveat: Celebrate responsibly—ideally at home—and do not engage in dangerous or illegal activities.  Such activities include shooting guns off in the air. What goes up will come down, and the results are tragic when people are hit by celebratory gunfire. Just last year, a woman in Texas was struck and killed by a descending bullet as she stood in her driveway to watch fireworks. There have been many other documented cases of celebratory gunfire killing innocent people. Police will monitor and respond to ShotSpotter activations throughout the city. Officers will arrest anyone caught discharging a firearm in public.  As a reminder, city law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of a structure. Never drink and drive. Officers will be actively looking for impaired motorists.  Lastly, please adhere to the Governor’s health regulations regarding Covid-19. Wear a mask, social distance and do not attend gatherings with people from outside of your home.  Be safe, Pittsburghers, as we rightfully banish 2020 to the ash heap of history and turn a hopeful eye to what might lie ahead.     "

Online Restaurant Registration
Pittsburgh Restaurant Week is a celebration of restaurants and dining in the steel city. Started in 2012, it’s been an annual tradition to host a winter edition in January and summer edition in August. The winter edition focuses of celebrating “New Dishes for the New Year” while the summer edition features dishes taking advantage of the local produce and harvests with lighter fare.
What’s Required?
In order to participate in restaurant week, the restaurant is expected to create a limited-time small menu that is offered for dine-in guests during the dinner meals between the dates of the celebration alongside the restaurant’s normal menu. While many restaurants opt for a multi-course menu with multiple options per course, that is not the designated requirement. See more details on pricing below.
Get Listed: Complete The Online Registration Process
Restaurant registration is accepted on a rolling basis up until the celebration. A restaurant must complete the online registration form and submit timely payment to appear on the listing of restaurants and on the participating restaurant map.
The registration form will ask for the anticipated pricing structure (multi-course vs special entrees, but the exact pricing structure is NOT locked in until menu is provided.
On the restaurant listing page, the restaurant appears at the bottom of the page until the menu is received.
Get Promoted: Submit Menu For Advertising
Once the limited-time menu has been determined, upload the special menu through the website to receive the full benefit of the celebration. It is recommended the menu is provided as text-only and not embedded in a prepared graphic. Once the menu is provided, it will be posted to the restaurant’s profile.
Menus submitted before the posted deadline will be formatted and shared through Pittsburgh Restaurant Week’s social media platforms.
Menus provided after the deadline will be posted to the website but will forfeit the benefit of the social media versions being created.
More On Pricing
With such a wide variety of establishments participating, a one-size-fits all pricing model doesn’t make sense, so Pittsburgh Restaurant Week has themed pricing of “24-cents” for 2024. All special menus should follow that pricing model. Common pricing options include:
Fixed-price 3-course meal for $20.24-45.24.  This variable price point allows restaurants to price their menus’ accordingly. Menu items do not have to come from the restaurant’s regular menu, but should be representative of the restaurant’s style of cooking. As an example, restaurants whose normal ﬁxed price menu is above $35, create a special menu for Restaurant Week for $35.24.
$20.24 Specialty Items in honor of Restaurant Week 2024. This could be a specialty entrée, appetizer-entrée combination or even stretched to “Dinner for Two” depending on the pricing structure that best fits the restaurant.

What was the name of the team formed in 1943 when the Steelers merged with the Philadelphia Eagles?,"

            The name of the team formed in 1943 when the Steelers merged with the Philadelphia Eagles was called the ""Steagles.""","  The Pittsburgh Steelers are a professional American football team based in Pittsburgh. The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933, the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC.[6] In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre-merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post-merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s.[7][8][9] The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships, tied with the Denver Broncos, but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos, Dallas Cowboys, and San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight. The Steelers, whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s, joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933. The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name, as was common practice for NFL teams at the time.[6] To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the Rooneymen, an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding.[10] Art Rooney's son, Dan Rooney, owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son, Art Rooney II. The Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation.[11] They currently play their home games at Acrisure Stadium on Pittsburgh's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers. Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium, which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and at Forbes Field.","   History Further information: History of the Pittsburgh Steelers See also: American football in Western Pennsylvania Rooney family era (1933–present) The Steelers first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23–2 to the New York Giants.[6] Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 (1936).[12] Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White, a future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions.[6][13] Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers.[14] During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season, they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the ""Phil-Pitt Eagles"" and were known as the ""Steagles"". This team went 5–4–1.[15] In 1944, they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the ""Carpets"").[6] This team finished 0–10, marking the only winless team in franchise history.[16] The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947, tying for first place in the division at 8–4 with the Philadelphia Eagles. This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field, which the Steelers lost 21–0.[17] That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a ""Playoff Bowl"" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff.[18] In 1970, the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL–NFL merger, the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league.[19] The Steelers also received a $3 million ($24.3 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team.[20]","   2017 13–3   2020 12–4   Total Division Championships won:  24  Logo and uniforms Further information: Logos and uniforms of the Pittsburgh Steelers A US Airways A319 featuring the colors and logo of the Pittsburgh Steelers. This Airbus A319 has since been repainted into American Airlines colors after the merger. The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the ""Steagles""; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used ""Vegas Gold"", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers ""gold"" is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the city's official flag. The Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the ""Steelmark"", originally designed by Pittsburgh's U.S. Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). In fact, it was Cleveland-based Republic Steel that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word ""Steelers"" surrounded by three astroids (hypocycloids of four cusps). The original meanings behind the astroids were, ""Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world."" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel.[100] While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word ""Steel"", the team was given permission to add ""ers"" in 1963 after a petition to AISI. The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently.[101] A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more. The Steelers, along with the New York Giants, are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The current uniform designs were introduced in 1968. The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In 1997, the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font (Futura Condensed) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey. The 2007–2011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in 2007. They were meant to evoke the memory of the 1963–1964 era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only. In 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their 1934 season. The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal striped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the ""bumblebee jerseys"" due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season.[102] Also in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black Color Rush uniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants. In 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from 1968 to 1997, coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed.[103] In 1979, the team owners were approached by then-Iowa Hawkeyes Head Coach Hayden Fry about designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers.[104] Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors.","  Philadelphia Eagles Main article: Eagles–Steelers rivalry The Philadelphia Eagles and Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967, they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35–13. The Steelers have lost ten straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 49–29–3.[126]","  ^ Burton, Jack (October 20, 2009). ""The NFL's Greatest Franchise: The Pittsburgh Steelers' Way"". Bleacher Report.

They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post-season battles in the past, most notably the Las Vegas Raiders, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, and Tennessee Titans. They also have an intrastate rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles, but under the current scheduling the teams play each other only once every four years.[105][106][107]","  Divisional rivals Cleveland Browns Main article: Browns–Steelers rivalry The Steelers and Cleveland Browns have been divisional rivals since the two cities' teams began playing against each other in 1950. After posting a 9–31 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers have gone 66–27–1 (including 42–6 in games played in Pittsburgh) since 1970 and currently lead the series 75–58–1;[108] The Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL in 1999 and won twelve straight meetings between 2003 and 2009. Additionally, the Browns posted losing streaks of 16 (1970–85) and 15 (2004–present) games in Pittsburgh. Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher coached the Browns special teams and secondary before following Marty Schottenheimer for a brief tenure as Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator and then hired by Pittsburgh. This has only intensified the rivalry. The teams have met three times in the postseason (1994, 2002, and 2021) with the Steelers winning the first two meetings, but losing the most recent in 2021.[109][110]","  Conference New England Patriots Main article: Patriots–Steelers rivalry The New England Patriots emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field, though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in 1996 28–3 while the Steelers won 7–6 in 1997; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in Ty Law and Curtis Martin. Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival New York Jets. Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30–14 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the 2004 NFL season. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15–1 regular season. The Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten-year period (1998–2007) before the Steelers broke through with a 33–10 victory at Foxborough in 2008, after Matt Cassel turned the ball over five times. The Patriots in 2013 then made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55–31. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28–21) and 2016's regular season (27–16) and then won 36–17 in the 2016 AFC Championship Game. They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end Jesse James was controversially called back.[116] Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17–10 on December 16, 2018, in Pittsburgh. In the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135–75, with the Patriots maintaining a 4–1 record. The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the Los Angeles Chargers (2–1), the Jacksonville Jaguars (2–0), and the Denver Broncos (5–3). The Steelers have an all-time regular-season record of 15–13 against the Patriots.[117] In the Bill Belichick era, the main period of the rivalry, the Patriots have a 12–4 record against the Steelers. In their last matchup, the Patriots beat the Steelers 33–3 on Sunday Night Football.","  Cincinnati Reds[edit] Main article: Pirates-Reds rivalry The Pirates' biggest divisional rival is the Cincinnati Reds, given the two teams' proximity, the carryover of the cities' football rivalry, and the fact that the Reds and Pirates have met six times in the postseason,[61] most recently in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. In the 2010s, the two teams frequently hit each other with pitches, occasionally resulting in brawls.[62]  Divisional foes[edit] From 2013 to 2015, the Pirates battled with the St. Louis Cardinals for the Central Division title, with the Cardinals narrowly winning the division each year. The two teams faced off in the 2013 National League Division Series, which the Cardinals won in five games. The Pirates had a contentious[63] battle with the Milwaukee Brewers for a Wild Card spot in 2014 and faced off against the Chicago Cubs in the 2015 National League Wild Card Game. The Cubs were major rivals for the Pirates earlier in their history, as both were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s and the Cubs eliminated the Pirates from the pennant race in the last week of  the 1938 season.","  Baltimore Ravens Main article: Ravens–Steelers rivalry Pittsburgh's rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens has had several memorable matchups and has escalated into a fierce divisional rivalry. Both teams handed the other their first losses at their current home stadiums. The Steelers won the inaugural game played at Baltimore's M&T Bank Stadium in 1998, 20–13, and three years later the Ravens handed the Steelers their first-ever loss at Heinz Field, 13–10. Later that season (2001) Pittsburgh won a divisional playoff game 27–10 against Baltimore, who was the defending Super Bowl champion. During their NFL championship season in 2000, the Ravens defeated the Steelers in Pittsburgh, 16–0, in the season opener with the Steelers later exacting revenge, 9–6, in Baltimore (the Ravens' final loss of the season). During the Steelers 2008 Championship run, they beat the Ravens three times, including a win in the AFC Championship game. The two teams complement each other by consistently fielding strong defenses. The Steelers lead the all-time series (including playoffs), 32–24.[111] The teams have met four times in the postseason, with the Steelers owning a 3–1 record.[112]"
What is the origin of Pittsburgh's shared black and gold color scheme among its professional sports teams?,"

            Pittsburgh's shared black and gold color scheme among its professional sports teams has a rich history that dates back to the late 19th century.

            The origins of Pittsburgh's black and gold colors can be traced back to the city's founding father, William Pitt, who served as the British Prime Minister from 1766 to 1768. Pitt's coat of arms featured a black shield with a golden tree stump in the center, which is believed to have inspired Pittsburgh's shared black and gold color scheme among its professional sports teams.

            The first professional sports team in Pittsburgh to adopt the black and gold colors was the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, which began wearing the colors during the 1948 season. Prior to that, the Pirates had worn various shades of blue and red.

            The Pittsburgh Steelers football team also adopted the black and gold colors around the same time as the Pirates, during the late 1940s or early 1950s. However, the Steelers' adoption of the black and gold colors is not as well-documented as the Pirates' adoption of the colors.

            The Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team did not adopt the black and gold colors until much later, during the late 1980s or early 1990s. Prior to that, the Penguins had worn various shades of blue and white.

            Today, Pittsburgh's professional sports teams continue to share the city's iconic black and gold colors. The shared color scheme has become a source of pride and unity for the city and its residents.","  Sports[edit] Main article: Sports in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh hosted the first professional football game and the first World Series. In 2009, Pittsburgh won the Sporting News title of ""Best Sports City"" in the United States[198] and, in 2013, Sperling's Best Places ""top 15 cities for baseball"".[199] College sports also have large followings with the University of Pittsburgh in football and sharing Division I basketball fans with Robert Morris and Duquesne. Pittsburgh has a long history with its major professional sports teams—the Steelers of the National Football League, the Penguins of the National Hockey League, and the Pirates of Major League Baseball—which all share the same team colors, the official city colors of black and gold.[f] Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States where this practice of sharing team colors in solidarity takes place.[200] The black-and-gold color scheme has since become widely associated with the city and personified in its famous Terrible Towel.[201] Further, the Pittsburgh Riverhounds professional soccer team of the USL Championship division wear black and gold colors. ""Rails to Trails"", has converted miles of former rail tracks to recreational trails, including a Pittsburgh-Washington D.C. bike/walking trail.[202] Several mountain biking trails are within the city and suburbs, Frick Park has biking trails and Hartwood Acres Park has many miles of single track trails.[203][204]","   2017 13–3   2020 12–4   Total Division Championships won:  24  Logo and uniforms Further information: Logos and uniforms of the Pittsburgh Steelers A US Airways A319 featuring the colors and logo of the Pittsburgh Steelers. This Airbus A319 has since been repainted into American Airlines colors after the merger. The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the ""Steagles""; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used ""Vegas Gold"", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers ""gold"" is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the city's official flag. The Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the ""Steelmark"", originally designed by Pittsburgh's U.S. Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). In fact, it was Cleveland-based Republic Steel that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word ""Steelers"" surrounded by three astroids (hypocycloids of four cusps). The original meanings behind the astroids were, ""Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world."" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel.[100] While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word ""Steel"", the team was given permission to add ""ers"" in 1963 after a petition to AISI. The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently.[101] A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more. The Steelers, along with the New York Giants, are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The current uniform designs were introduced in 1968. The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In 1997, the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font (Futura Condensed) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey. The 2007–2011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in 2007. They were meant to evoke the memory of the 1963–1964 era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only. In 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their 1934 season. The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal striped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the ""bumblebee jerseys"" due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season.[102] Also in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black Color Rush uniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants. In 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from 1968 to 1997, coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed.[103] In 1979, the team owners were approached by then-Iowa Hawkeyes Head Coach Hayden Fry about designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers.[104] Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors.","     See also: American football in Western Pennsylvania   Main article: Pittsburgh As the home of the MLB's Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, PNC Park is located in North Shore, in front of the Allegheny River, Roberto Clemente Bridge, and the Pittsburgh city skyline. Sports in Pittsburgh have been played dating back to the American Civil War. Baseball, hockey, and the first professional American football game had been played in the city by 1892. Pittsburgh was first known as the ""City of Champions"" when the Pittsburgh Pirates, Pittsburgh Panthers football team, and Pittsburgh Steelers won multiple championships in the 1970s.[1] Today, the city has three major professional sports franchises, the Pirates, Steelers, and Penguins; while the University of Pittsburgh Panthers compete in a Division I Power Five conference, the highest level of collegiate athletics in the United States, in both football and basketball. Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris also field Division I teams in men's and women's basketball and Division I FCS teams in football. Robert Morris also fields Division I men's and women's ice hockey teams. Pittsburgh's major teams have seen great success, with the MLB's Pirates winning 5 World Series titles, the NHL's Penguins winning 5 Stanley Cups, and the NFL's Steelers winning a tied league record 6 Super Bowls. The Pittsburgh Panthers have also been successful in the NCAA with 9 national championships in football and 2 in basketball. The flag of Pittsburgh is colored with black and gold, based on the colors of William Pitt's coat of arms; Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States in which all professional sporting teams share the same colors. The city's first National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates, and that team's non-NHL predecessor, the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets, wore black and gold as their colors in the 1920s. The colors were adopted by founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Art Rooney, in 1933. In 1948, the Pittsburgh baseball Pirates switched their colors from red and blue to black and gold. Pittsburgh's second NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Penguins, wore blue and white, due to then-general manager Jack Riley's upbringing in Ontario. In 1979, after the Steelers and Pirates had each won their respective league championships, the Penguins altered their color scheme to match, despite objections from the Boston Bruins,[2][3] who have used the black and gold combination since the 1935–36 NHL season.[4][5] In 1975, late Steelers radio broadcaster Myron Cope invented the Terrible Towel, which has become ""arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team.""[6] Cope was one of multiple sports figures born in Pittsburgh and its surrounding area; others include golfer Arnold Palmer, Olympian and retired professional wrestler Kurt Angle, and basketball player Jack Twyman.  Pittsburgh is also sometimes called the ""Cradle of Quarterbacks""[7][8] due to the number of prominent players of that position who hail from the area, including NFL greats Jim Kelly, George Blanda, Johnny Unitas, Joe Namath, Dan Marino, and Joe Montana.","  Team information Crest and sweater design When the Penguins made their NHL debut in 1967, the team wore the colors dark blue, light blue and white. The uniforms had the word ""Pittsburgh"" written diagonally down the front of the sweater with three dark blue stripes around the sleeves and bottom. The logo featured a hockey-playing penguin in a scarf over an inverted triangle, symbolizing the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh. A refined version of the logo appeared on a redesigned uniform in the second season, which removed the scarf and gave the penguin a sleeker look. The circle encompassing the logo was later removed.[73] The team's colors were originally powder blue, navy blue, and white. The powder blue was changed to royal blue in 1973 but returned in 1977. The team adopted the current black and gold color scheme in 1980 to unify the colors of the city's professional sports teams although, like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Steelers, the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow. The change was not without controversy, as the Boston Bruins protested by claiming to own the rights to the black and gold colors. However, the Penguins cited the colors worn by the now-defunct NHL team the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1920s, as well as black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and its namesake, and obtained permission to use the black and gold colors. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates used old Pittsburgh Police uniforms,[74] beginning the black and gold color tradition in the city.[73] The Penguins generally wore the black and gold ""skating penguin"" uniform between 1980 and 1992, with a few noticeable changes in the lettering and striping. A gold alternate uniform was worn between 1980 and 1984, and briefly replaced the white uniform for home games in the 1983–84 season.[73] In the 1992–93 season, the Penguins unveiled new uniforms and introduced the ""flying penguin"" logo, or ""Robopenguin"".[75][76] The team's away uniforms were a throwback to the team's first season, as they revived the diagonal ""Pittsburgh"" script. In 1995, the team introduced their second alternate jersey, featuring different stripe designs on each sleeve. This jersey proved to be so popular that the team adopted it as their away jersey in 1997. In 2000, the Penguins brought back the ""skating penguin"" logo, but with a ""Vegas gold"" shade, upon releasing its new alternate uniform. After 2002, the ""skating penguin"" was readopted as the primary, though the ""flying penguin"" remained the alternate. A corresponding white version of the ""Vegas gold"" uniforms was introduced, and the 1995–2002 black uniform was retired. When the new jerseys were unveiled for the 2007–08 season league wide, the Penguins made major striping pattern changes and removed the ""flying penguin"" logo from the shoulders.[73]","  Figures with broadcasting resumés[edit]  Nellie Briles Steve Blass Joe Garagiola Ralph Kiner Bob Walk John Wehner  See also[edit]  Baseball portalPittsburgh portalPennsylvania portal List of Pittsburgh Pirates seasons Green Weenie References[edit]   ^ ""Pirates Uniforms and Logos"".

And because even the most garish styles tend to go and come around again, the bumblebee yellow jerseys, striped black pants and pillbox-style hats of the 1970s made a recent return as the go-to Sunday throwbacks."

            The Clemente Award is presented to the player who best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, and community involvement.","      Why Pittsburgh Loves Roberto Clemente  Clemente was not only known for his baseball talent, he was also known for giving back to the community. He was very involved in delivering relief packages to to the people of Managua, Nicaragua after they were affected by a earthquake. Clemente learned that some of the aid packages weren't making it to the victims so he accompanied the team to Nicaragua on the 4th relief flight on New Years Eve. The plane crashed due to mechanical errors, and Roberto Clemente and the four others on the plane died. The baseball world was forever changed. Clemente is honored all throughout Pittsburgh. A bridge is named after him, PNC Park has a statue dedicated to him, and there is a Roberto Clemente Museum. The Pirates and Major League Baseball do so much to honor this national hero.

What significant event occurred in 1999 regarding the Pittsburgh Penguins franchise?,"
            Mario Lemieux, a Hall of Fame hockey player and former Penguins captain, bought the Pittsburgh Penguins franchise from the Canaveral Corporation in 1999. Lemieux had previously played for the Penguins from 1984 to 1997, leading the team to two Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. After buying the franchise, Lemieux served as the team's chairman and chief executive officer until 2011, when he stepped down from his role as CEO but remained as the team's chairman. Under Lemieux's ownership, the Penguins have won two more Stanley Cup championships in 2009 and 2016, making a total of five Stanley Cup titles for the franchise during Lemieux's tenure as owner.",    Pittsburgh Penguins - Wikipedia                                    Jump to content        Main menu      Main menu move to sidebar hide      Navigation     Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact us        Contribute     HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload fileSpecial pages                    Search            Search                       Appearance                 Donate  Create account  Log in         Personal tools      Donate Create account Log in        Pages for logged out editors learn more    ContributionsTalk                             Contents move to sidebar hide     (Top)      1 History     Toggle History subsection      1.1 Early years (1967–1984)       1.1.1 Triumph of playoff berths and tragedy of Briere (1969–1974)         1.1.2 Playoff runs and a uniform change (1974–1982)           1.2 Lemieux–Jagr era (1984–2005)       1.2.1 Back-to-back Stanley Cup titles (1989–1997)         1.2.2 Lemieux's retirement and return (1997–2001),"                      Appearance move to sidebar hide            From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   National Hockey League team in Pennsylvania   Pittsburgh Penguins 2024–25 Pittsburgh Penguins seasonConferenceEasternDivisionMetropolitanFounded1967HistoryPittsburgh Penguins1967–presentHome arenaPPG Paints ArenaCityPittsburgh, PennsylvaniaTeam colorsBlack, Pittsburgh gold, white[1][2][3]     MediaSportsNet PittsburghThe X (105.9 FM)ESPN Pittsburgh (970 AM)Pittsburgh Penguins Radio NetworkOwner(s)Fenway Sports GroupMario Lemieux (minority)[4]General managerKyle DubasHead coachMike SullivanCaptainSidney CrosbyMinor league affiliatesWilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins (AHL)Wheeling Nailers (ECHL)Stanley Cups5 (1990–91, 1991–92, 2008–09, 2015–16, 2016–17)Conference championships6 (1990–91, 1991–92, 2007–08, 2008–09, 2015–16, 2016–17)Presidents' Trophy1 (1992–93)Division championships9 (1990–91, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1995–96, 1997–98, 2007–08, 2012–13, 2013–14, 2020–21)Official websitenhl.com/penguins The Pittsburgh Penguins (colloquially known as the Pens) are a professional ice hockey team based in Pittsburgh. The Penguins compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The team has played its home games at PPG Paints Arena since 2010, and has previously played at the Civic Arena, which was better known by its nickname ""the Igloo"". The Penguins are affiliated with two minor league teams – the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Wheeling Nailers of the ECHL. Founded during the 1967 expansion, the Penguins have qualified for six Stanley Cup Finals, winning the Stanley Cup five times – in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017. Along with the Edmonton Oilers, the Penguins are tied for the most Stanley Cup championships among the non-Original Six teams and sixth overall. With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017, the Penguins became the first back-to-back champions in the salary cap era. Several of the team's former members have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, including co-owner Mario Lemieux, who purchased the Penguins in 1999 and brought the club out of bankruptcy. Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr, Sidney Crosby, and Evgeni Malkin have won the Hart Memorial Trophy while playing for the franchise.","  Hockey[edit] The NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins have played in Pittsburgh since the team's founding in 1967. The team has won 6 Eastern Conference titles (1991, 1992, 2008, 2009, 2016 and 2017) and 5 Stanley Cup championships (1991, 1992, 2009, 2016 and 2017). Since 1999, Hall of Famer and back-to-back playoff MVP Mario Lemieux has served as Penguins owner. Until moving into the PPG Paints Arena in 2010 (when it was known as Consol Energy Center), the team played their home games at the world's first retractable domed stadium, the Civic Arena, or in local parlance ""The Igloo"".[212] Ice hockey has had a regional fan base since the 1890s semi-pro Keystones. The city's first ice rink dates back to 1889, when there was an ice rink at the Casino in Schenley Park. From 1896 to 1956, the Exposition Building on the Allegheny River near The Point and Duquesne Gardens in Oakland offered indoor skating.[213] The NHL awarded one of its first franchises to the city in 1924 on the strength of the back-to-back USAHA championship-winning Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates made several Stanley Cup playoff runs before folding from Great Depression financial pressures. Hockey survived with the Pittsburgh Hornets farm team (1936–1967) and their seven finals appearances and three championships in 18 playoff seasons. Robert Morris University fields a Division I college hockey team at the Island Sports Center. Pittsburgh has semi-pro and amateur teams such as the Pittsburgh Penguins Elite.[214] Pro-grade ice rinks in the region include the Rostraver Ice Garden and Iceoplex at Southpointe.","  Crosby, Bill Guerin, and Chris Kunitz during the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals. The Penguins defeated the Detroit Red Wings in the Finals, earning their third Stanley Cup title. In the 2008–09 season, Malkin won the Art Ross and was again a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy. Crosby finished third in League scoring with 33 goals and 70 assists for 103 points, despite missing five games. The Penguins' record dipped mid-season but lifted after Dan Bylsma replaced head coach Therrien. The effect was almost instantaneous, and the Penguins recovered enough to secure home-ice advantage in their first-round match up against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom the Penguins defeated in six games. It took seven games for the Penguins to win the next series against Washington, sending them to the conference finals, where they eliminated the Carolina Hurricanes in a four-game sweep. After defeating the Hurricanes, the Penguins earned their second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings, to whom they lost the previous year. After losing games 1 and 2 in Detroit, like the previous years, the Penguins won games 3 and 4 in Pittsburgh. Each team won on home ice in games 5 and 6. In game 7 in Detroit, Maxime Talbot scored two goals, including the game-winner, as the Penguins won 2–1 to win their third Stanley Cup title.[36] Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.[11] During the 2009–10 season, Crosby scored 109 points (51 goals and 58 assists) in 81 games, winning the Maurice ""Rocket"" Richard Trophy as the NHL season's leading goalscorer. The Penguins, seeded fourth in the East, began their title defense, defeating the Ottawa Senators in six games. In the next round, the Penguins faced the Montreal Canadiens. The teams swapped wins in the series en route to the decisive game 7, which the Penguins lost 5–2, ending their season and their tenure at Mellon Arena.[37]","  ^ ""All about NHL goal horns"".

What venues did the Pittsburgh Pirates use between 1882 and 1909?,"

            The Pittsburgh Pirates used several venues between 1882 and 1909. These include:

            1. Exposition Park I (1882) - This was the first venue used by the Pittsburgh Alleghenys, the forerunner of the Pittsburgh Pirates. The park was located on the site of what is now Heinz Field in the North Shore area of Pittsburgh.

            2. Exposition Park II (1883) - This was the second venue used by the Pittsburgh Alleghenys. It was also located on the North Shore of Pittsburgh, near where the Allegheny River meets the Monongahela River to form the Ohio River.

            3. Recreation Park (1884-1890) - This was the third venue used by the Pittsburgh Alleghenys. It was located in the Bloomfield neighborhood of Pittsburgh, near where Liberty Avenue intersects with Baum Boulevard.

            4. Exposition Park III (1891-1909) - This was the fourth and final venue used by the Pittsburgh Pirates before they moved to Forbes Field in 1909. It was located on the site of what is now PNC Park in the North Shore area of Pittsburgh.

            I hope this information is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.","  Former ballparks[edit] The Pirates' first home was Exposition Park, located a couple blocks west of the current location of PNC Park. The Pirates split their early years between that ballpark and Recreation Park, which was located further inland from the flood-prone Allegheny River. The Pirates moved back to Exposition Park for good in 1891, and remained there until the 1909 season.[28] The park hosted the first modern World Series ever played in 1903 but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920.[29] The site is currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, although a historical marker near the intersection of West Gen. Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive notes it was the location of the first World Series.","   Pittsburgh Pirates 2025 Pittsburgh Pirates season LogoCap insignia Established in 1882Major league affiliations National League (1887–present) Central Division (1994–present) East Division (1969–1993) American Association (1882–1886) Current uniformRetired numbers1489112021334042Colors Black, gold, white[1][2][3]      Name Pittsburgh Pirates (1891–present) Pittsburgh Alleghenys (1887–1890) Allegheny (1882–1886) Other nicknames Bucs Buccos The Lumber Company Ballpark PNC Park (2001–present) Three Rivers Stadium (1970–2000) Forbes Field (1909–1970) Exposition Park III (1891–1909) Recreation Park (1884–1890) Exposition Park I, II (1882–1883) Major league titlesWorld Series titles (5)19091925196019711979NL Pennants (9)190119021903190919251927196019711979NL Central Division titles (0)NoneNL East Division titles (9)197019711972197419751979199019911992Wild card berths (3)201320142015Front officePrincipal owner(s)Bob Nutting[4]PresidentTravis WilliamsGeneral managerBen CheringtonManagerDerek SheltonMascot(s)Pirate ParrotWebsitemlb.com/pirates The Pittsburgh Pirates are an American professional baseball team based in Pittsburgh. The Pirates compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central Division. Founded as part of the American Association in 1881 under the name Pittsburgh Alleghenys, the club joined the National League in 1887 and was a member of the National League East from 1969 through 1993. The Pirates have won five World Series championships, nine National League pennants, nine National League East division titles and made three appearances in the Wild Card Game. The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball at the start of the 20th century, playing in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and winning their first title in 1909 behind Honus Wagner. The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They won again in 1971 behind Roberto Clemente, the first Latin-American enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and in 1979 under the leadership of Willie Stargell. Since their last World Series in 1979, the Pirates have largely endured a period of great struggle. Since then, they have only had eleven winning seasons, six postseason appearances, three division titles, and have advanced just once in the postseason with a victory in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. The Pirates additionally posted a losing record in 20 consecutive seasons from 1993 to 2012, a record streak in both MLB and the four major North American professional sports leagues.[5] The Pirates currently have the fifth-longest World Series championship drought, the longest pennant drought in the National League,[6] and the longest League Championship Series appearance and division championship drought in all of baseball. From 1882 to 2024, the Pirates have an overall record of 10,839–10,819–140 (.500 winning 'percentage').[7] The Pirates are also often referred to as the ""Bucs"" or the ""Buccos"" (derived from buccaneer, a synonym for pirate). Since 2001 the team has played its home games at PNC Park, a 39,000-seat stadium along the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side. The Pirates previously played at Forbes Field from 1909 to 1970 and at Three Rivers Stadium from 1970 to 2000.

The Pirates are nine-time Pennant winners and five-time World Series Champions, were in the first World Series (1903) and claim two pre-World Series titles in 1901 and 1902. The Pirates play in PNC Park. Pittsburgh also has a rich Negro league history, with the former Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays credited with as many as 14 league titles and 11 Hall of Famers between them in the 1930s and 1940s, while the Keystones fielded teams in the 1920s. In addition, in 1971 the Pirates were the first Major League team to field an all-minority lineup. One sportswriter claimed, ""No city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh.""[205] Since the late 20th century, the Pirates had three consecutive National League Championship Series appearances (1990–92) (going 6, 7 and 7 games each), followed by setting the MLB record for most consecutive losing seasons, with 20 from 1993 until 2012. This era was followed by three consecutive postseason appearances: the 2013 National League Division Series and the 2014–2015 Wild Card games. Their September pennant race in 1997 featured the franchises' last no-hitter and last award for Sporting News' Executive of the Year.[206]","  Professional[edit] Major league    Team  Founded  League  Sport  Venue  Championships   Pittsburgh Pirates  1882  Major League Baseball (MLB)  Baseball  PNC Park  7[o 1]   Pittsburgh Steelers  1933  National Football League (NFL)  Football  Acrisure Stadium  6[o 2]   Pittsburgh Penguins  1967  National Hockey League (NHL)  Hockey  PPG Paints Arena  5[o 3]  Minor league/other    Team  Founded  League  Sport  Venue  Championships   Pittsburgh Riverhounds  1999  USL Championship (USLC)  Soccer  Highmark Stadium     Steel City Yellow Jackets  2014  ABA  Basketball  A Giving Heart Community Center  1    ^ The Pirates won championships in 1901, 1902, 1909, 1925, 1960, 1971, and 1979. 1901 and 1902 were Pre World-Series Era Champions.  ^ The Steelers won championships in 1974, 1975, 1978, 1979, 2005, and 2008.  ^ The Penguins won championships in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017."

What I absolutely loved about the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum, however, is that is paints a complete picture of the Steelers franchise that lets guests truly understand the team. The very first panel you'll see in the museum harkens back to football history, noting that the first professional football game was played in Latrobe (hey, that's my hometown!), just a short drive from Pittsburgh. You'll see the struggles of the early teams, the impact of World War II on the rosters and the difficulties Art Rooney had to overcome. In the end, experiencing so much history about non-championship seasons made me appreciate those Ws even more.

Whether you prefer to bike, walk, rollerblade or simply gather with friends for a picnic, green getaways and outdoor adventures are aplenty in Pittsburgh.

Plus, Pittsburgh has become known as a city that supports and encourages bicycling, with bike-accessible hotels and public transportation, an easy-to-use bikeshare system and a devoted community of cyclists. In fact, People for Bikes, one of the nation’s leading organizations dedicated to making bicycling safer, more convenient and appealing for everyone, recognizes Pittsburgh among the best places to bike in the world. Pittsburgh’s unique topographical blend of steep, winding hills and flat river areas makes it one of the best cities for cycling enthusiasts.

Some of Pittsburgh’s most famous guided tours allow visitors to explore the city’s 90 unique neighborhoods by foot or bike, like Bike the Burgh and ‘Burgh Bits & Bites Food Tour.

Perhaps the most famous trail is the Great Allegheny Passage – locally known as the GAP trail – a 150-mile, non-motorized path that connects Pittsburgh to the C&O Canal Towpath in Cumberland, Maryland, creating a 355-mile continuous experience to Washington, D.C. For those not ready to tackle the entire path, consider renting a bicycle from Golden Triangle Bike and enjoying a leisurely ride along the Monongahela River. Looking to stay more local?

Throughout the parks and trails intertwined across the city, visitors will find an array of beautiful scenery, including more than 3,500 native Eastern redbud trees planted over the past five years by The Pittsburgh Redbud Project. With more than 30 miles of river shoreline, it is only fitting that Pittsburgh is a premier location for recreational boating, fishing and a variety of other water sports.

In what years did the Pittsburgh Triangles tennis team play at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena?,"

            The Pittsburgh Triangles tennis team did not play at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. 

            The Pittsburgh Civic Arena was primarily used for ice hockey and basketball games, and it did host some tennis events, but these were typically one-off exhibitions or charity events featuring well-known tennis players, rather than regular team competitions like the Pittsburgh Triangles tennis team.","  Arenas The Penguins called Civic Arena home for over 45 seasons from their inception in 1967. In September 2010, they completed the move to the state-of-the-art Consol Energy Center (now named the PPG Paints Arena). The Penguins also played two ""home"" games in the Cleveland suburb of Richfield, Ohio, in 1992 and 1993 at the Richfield Coliseum (this is not unlike the Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA playing an annual pre-season game in Pittsburgh;[90] the Philadelphia 76ers used the Civic Arena as a second home in the early 1970s).[91]",What are the tennis facilities available in Pittsburgh?,"   US Open 9 Oakmont Country Club 1927, 1935, 1953, 1962, 1973,  1983, 1994, 2007, 2016   Ryder Cup 1 Laurel Valley Golf Club 1975   MLB All Star Game 5 Forbes FieldThree Rivers StadiumPNC Park 1944, 19591974, 19942006   NHL All Star Game 1 Pittsburgh Civic Arena 1990   NHL Entry Draft 2 Pittsburgh Civic ArenaPPG Paints Arena 19972012   NHL Stadium Series 1 Acrisure Stadium 2017   NHL Winter Classic 1 Acrisure Stadium 2011   AHL All-Star Game 1 Duquesne Gardens 1956   NCAA Men's Final Four Tournament 3 Pittsburgh Civic ArenaPPG Paints Arena 1997, 20022012   NCAA Men's Frozen Four Tournament 1 PPG Paints Arena 2013   NCAA Women's Final Four Tournament 3 Pittsburgh Civic ArenaPetersen Events Center 20012007, 2010  Annual events[edit] Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix Pittsburgh also hosts several annual major sporting events, including the:  Three Rivers Regatta (Since 1977) Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix (Since 1983) Dirty Dozen Cycle Race (Since 1983) Pittsburgh Marathon (Since 1985) Great Race 10K (Since 1985) Head of the Ohio Regatta (Since 1987) Three Rivers Classic (Since 2012) Great Pittsburgh Soap Box Derby Mckeesport Pa The city's vibrant rivers have attracted annual world title competitions of the Forrest Wood Cup in 2009 and the Bassmaster Classic in 2005.

The pierogis make this visually stunning (it's absolutely a requirement to take photos of every angle before eating) but my favorite elements of this came from the combo of the briny pickles and savory shredded beef and onions.

The team has won 6 Eastern Conference titles (1991, 1992, 2008, 2009, 2016 and 2017) and 5 Stanley Cup championships (1991, 1992, 2009, 2016 and 2017). Since 1999, Hall of Famer and back-to-back playoff MVP Mario Lemieux has served as Penguins owner. Until moving into the PPG Paints Arena in 2010 (when it was known as Consol Energy Center), the team played their home games at the world's first retractable domed stadium, the Civic Arena, or in local parlance ""The Igloo"".[212] Ice hockey has had a regional fan base since the 1890s semi-pro Keystones. The city's first ice rink dates back to 1889, when there was an ice rink at the Casino in Schenley Park. From 1896 to 1956, the Exposition Building on the Allegheny River near The Point and Duquesne Gardens in Oakland offered indoor skating.[213] The NHL awarded one of its first franchises to the city in 1924 on the strength of the back-to-back USAHA championship-winning Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates made several Stanley Cup playoff runs before folding from Great Depression financial pressures. Hockey survived with the Pittsburgh Hornets farm team (1936–1967) and their seven finals appearances and three championships in 18 playoff seasons. Robert Morris University fields a Division I college hockey team at the Island Sports Center. Pittsburgh has semi-pro and amateur teams such as the Pittsburgh Penguins Elite.[214] Pro-grade ice rinks in the region include the Rostraver Ice Garden and Iceoplex at Southpointe.","  ^ ""Penguins acquire Kessel from Maple Leafs"".

Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season. There are typically 24 issues of the paper within a publishing year. The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers.com page.  Usage in popular culture The Steelers' success over several decades has permeated film and literature. The Steelers are portrayed in the following big-budget Hollywood films:  The January 11, 1975, episode of the Mary Tyler Moore Show featured Super Bowl IX (featuring the Steelers) as a plot device.[222] Black Sunday in 1977[223] Heaven Can Wait in 1978[224] Smokey and the Bandit II in 1980[225] Fighting Back in 1980[226] Hey Kid, Catch! in 1980[227] ...All the Marbles in 1981 Evening Shade (TV series) 1990–1994[228] The Waterboy cameo by Bill Cowher in 1998[229] The Longest Yard in 2005 The Chief a theater production.

The executives are told that not only would the ad firm have given them tickets to the Steelers' November 19, 1967, game at the Giants, the firm would have worked it so that the Steelers would have won (they lost 20–28). Concussion in 2015 features players from the team suffering from CTE.[233] The protagonist of John Grisham's novel The Associate is a staunch Steelers fan.[234] In the summer of 2019, the Kennywood theme park located near Pittsburgh, opened a new land themed to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Steelers Country, featuring a major record-breaking coaster, the Steel Curtain.[235] The land, in addition to this ride, features a Steelers-themed experience, and an 'End Zone Restaurant'.","          The History of the Luckiest Towel in Sports  The Terrible Towel was created by the late Myron Cope, the Pittsburgh Steelers broadcaster who needed a way to excite the team's fans during a 1975 playoff football game against the Baltimore Colts. Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout. The stands were filled that day and the Steelers always seemed to complete terrific plays when the towels were waving. The Steelers won, 28-10. The team moved on in the playoffs and for Super Bowl X in January 1976, the Steelers introduced gold towels with the words ""Myron Cope's Terrible Towel"" printed in black. The Steelers went on to beat the Dallas Cowboys, 21-17, many claiming, ""thanks to the Towel.""  In 1996 Mr. Cope gave the rights to ""Myron Cope's Official Terrible Towel"" to the Allegheny Valley School in the Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis. The school provides care for more than 900 children, adults and senior citizens with mental retardation and physical disabilities. Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise almost $1.1 million for the school. On Jan. 15, 2005, during the Steelers playoff run at Acrisure Stadium, VisitPittsburgh sponsored the ""World's Largest Terrible Towel Wave,"" reaching millions of Steelers fans around the world, known amongst themselves as ""Steelers Nation."" The team came back from what appeared to be a sure loss against the New York Jets, winning the game in overtime, 20-17. It appeared that the Towel had done it again.","  Here are some of our favorite Steelers facts for your next trivia night: Created by Steelers radio broadcaster, Myron Cope in 1975, the Terrible Towel is easily one of the most recognized symbols in the NFL and waving it during games has become a revered tradition. Steelers Tip: The Towel is for waving or decorating, not for drying your hands or using for any other towel-like purpose, which is believed to bring back luck.Sometime during the fourth quarter before a big play or series, the song Renegade by Styx resonates throughout Heinz Field. Playing the song is a tradition that's equally important for fans as it is for players and represents Pittsburgh's defensive strength in the fourth quarter. The tradition dates back to a 2002 comeback win against the Cleveland Browns.Make sure to visit the FedEx Great Hall inside Heinz Field; it's basically a shrine to the greatest moments in football history with Super Bowl trophies, jerseys, rings and more on display.In Pittsburgh, Big Ben was our 2x Super Bowl-winning quarterback, not a clock.Steelers aren't just inventive in their get-up, we also like to give incredible moments in football nicknames like The Immaculate Reception, The Steel Curtain, and, most recently in honor of six Super Bowl Championships, Sixburgh.While it's widely known that the Steelers are named for Pittsburgh's rich steel history, few recognize the meaning behind the logo. Each of the hypocycloids represent one of the three materials used to make steel. Yellow represents coal, red is for iron ore, and steel scrape is illustrated with blue. During games, you'll hear fans chanting ""Here We Go, Steelers!"" While it seems like a simple chant, there's some history behind this one too. Here We Go, originally written by Rodger Wood and recorded in 1994, was and still is intended as a Steelers fight song. Having sold more than 120,000 copies of the original, Here We Go is now regularly updated to mention current players' names and has become an anthem for the team during playoffs.Whether you're visiting for a game or just happen to be around the city during football season, you're sure to enjoy the unique Steelers atmosphere.

Another massive Terrible Towel Wave was organized but this time the Steelers lost, 41-27. The victors that day went on to win Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville. But the Steelers didn't give up on the Terrible Towel. On Halloween, Oct. 31, 2005, a special Terrible Towel was created to honor the retired Cope for his 35 years as a Steelers broadcaster and was waved prior to the Monday Night Football game between the Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens at Heinz Field (now named Acrisure Stadium). A limited edition of 35,000 were made, all with familiar ""Cope-isms"" like ""Yoi!"" By the way, that night, the Steelers won, 20-19."
What was the final score when the Steelers won their unprecedented sixth Super Bowl Championship?," The final score when the Steelers won their unprecedented sixth Super Bowl Championship was 27-24 in favor of the Pittsburgh Steelers over the Seattle Seahawks on February 1, 2006.","  The Pittsburgh Steelers are a professional American football team based in Pittsburgh. The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933, the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC.[6] In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre-merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post-merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s.[7][8][9] The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships, tied with the Denver Broncos, but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos, Dallas Cowboys, and San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight. The Steelers, whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s, joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933. The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name, as was common practice for NFL teams at the time.[6] To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the Rooneymen, an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding.[10] Art Rooney's son, Dan Rooney, owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son, Art Rooney II. The Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation.[11] They currently play their home games at Acrisure Stadium on Pittsburgh's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers. Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium, which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and at Forbes Field.","  Steelers' five Super Bowl rings before 2009 Cowher led the Steelers to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons, a feat that had been accomplished only by legendary coach Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns. In those first six seasons, Cowher coached them as deep as the AFC Championship Game three times and following the 1995 season an appearance in Super Bowl XXX on the strength of the ""Blitzburgh"" defense. However, the Steelers lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX, two weeks after a thrilling AFC Championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts.[33][34] Cowher produced the franchise's record-tying fifth Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XL over the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks ten years later.[35] With that victory, the Steelers became the third team to win five Super Bowls, and the first sixth-seeded playoff team to reach and win the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team post-season tournament in 1990. He coached through the 2006 season which ended with an 8–8 record, just short of the playoffs. Overall Cowher's teams reached the playoffs 10 of 15 seasons with six AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl berths and a championship. Cowher's career record with Pittsburgh was 149–90–1 in the regular season and 161–99–1 overall, including playoff games.[36]","  On Sunday, Jan. 23, 2011, the Steelers not only beat the New York Jets in the AFC Championship to advance to their third Super Bowl in six years, the game was played on what would have been Myron's 82nd birthday.

What unique event has occurred at PNC Park involving baseballs and the Allegheny River?,"70 home run balls have exited PNC Park and splashed into the Allegheny River. However, only five of these balls have landed in the river without bouncing.","          Pittsburgh Pirates Raise the Jolly Roger! Let's Go Bucs!          Baseball in Pittsburgh  The best time to visit Pittsburgh is during baseball season, and an evening in Pittsburgh is best spent at one of the most popular ballparks in all of baseball, PNC Park. With downtown Pittsburgh serving as a scenic backdrop and a dramatic entry via the Roberto Clemente Bridge along the Allegheny River, you'll see why Pittsburghers and visitors love to cheer for the Pittsburgh Pirates. ABC News, TripAdvisor, ESPN and more have named PNC Park as an ultimate site to catch a game with a spectacular view of the Downtown skyline. And there is always great events, promotions and giveaways during baseball season. Don't miss your chance to win t-shirts, hats, backpacks and bobble heads. You can have a front-row seat as you see the skyline light up on Fireworks Night, bring your dog to the ballpark on Pup Night every Tuesday, or stay after the game for a free concert on specific evenings.  While you are in town for a game, stop by the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum or the Clemente Museum and relive some of the great moments of Pittsburgh sports history. So round up your family and friends and make your way down to PNC Park to catch a game. Let’s Go Bucs!","                          Nightlife Pittsburgh PiratesCheck out the nicest ballpark in MLB while in town!

The Cincinnati Reds & Chicago Cubs will both be visiting. Win or lose, PNC Park is an awesome fan (and foodie) experience. The InclineNothing quite says “Pittsburgh” like our Inclines. The Monongahela incline shows a great view of Downtown. Meanwhile, the Duquesne Incline down the road also has a great view of The North Shore and Point State Park.

These stadiums are the homes of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Pirates, respectively. I go to PNC Park at least once every summer. It’s the most beautiful ballpark in baseball. The view of Downtown from behind home plate is breathtaking. If the weather is just right, a rainbow may arc over the skyline, beyond the outfield. If the Pirates are out of town during your visit, book a tour of the park – you’re sure to go home with a memorable photo! Though the food offerings in the stadiums are beyond standard fare, consider also grabbing a meal, snack or brew at one of the nearby restaurants or breweries. Southern Tier Brewery offers a full menu of gastropub fare with a ‘Burgh twist. I recommend the potato and cheddar pierogies and a Here We Gold Lager for the grownups. The large outdoor seating area is shaded, comfortable and great for people watching."

What accomplishment is unique to the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates in the history of all sports?,"

            The 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates were the first professional sports team in North America to have all of its major teams (baseball, football, and hockey) win their respective league championships within the same calendar year. This unique accomplishment is a testament to the strong athletic tradition and the exceptional talent pool that exists in the city of Pittsburgh and its surrounding area.","   ESPN  The Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, often referred to as the Bucs or the Buccos (derived from buccaneer), is the city's oldest professional sports franchise, having been founded in 1881, and plays in the Central Division of the National League. The Pirates are nine-time Pennant winners and five-time World Series Champions, were in the first World Series (1903) and claim two pre-World Series titles in 1901 and 1902. The Pirates play in PNC Park. Pittsburgh also has a rich Negro league history, with the former Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays credited with as many as 14 league titles and 11 Hall of Famers between them in the 1930s and 1940s, while the Keystones fielded teams in the 1920s. In addition, in 1971 the Pirates were the first Major League team to field an all-minority lineup. One sportswriter claimed, ""No city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh.""[205] Since the late 20th century, the Pirates had three consecutive National League Championship Series appearances (1990–92) (going 6, 7 and 7 games each), followed by setting the MLB record for most consecutive losing seasons, with 20 from 1993 until 2012. This era was followed by three consecutive postseason appearances: the 2013 National League Division Series and the 2014–2015 Wild Card games. Their September pennant race in 1997 featured the franchises' last no-hitter and last award for Sporting News' Executive of the Year.[206]","   Bibliography[edit] Markusen, Bruce.

Sports in Pittsburgh have been played dating back to the American Civil War. Baseball, hockey, and the first professional American football game had been played in the city by 1892. Pittsburgh was first known as the ""City of Champions"" when the Pittsburgh Pirates, Pittsburgh Panthers football team, and Pittsburgh Steelers won multiple championships in the 1970s.[1] Today, the city has three major professional sports franchises, the Pirates, Steelers, and Penguins; while the University of Pittsburgh Panthers compete in a Division I Power Five conference, the highest level of collegiate athletics in the United States, in both football and basketball. Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris also field Division I teams in men's and women's basketball and Division I FCS teams in football. Robert Morris also fields Division I men's and women's ice hockey teams. Pittsburgh's major teams have seen great success, with the MLB's Pirates winning 5 World Series titles, the NHL's Penguins winning 5 Stanley Cups, and the NFL's Steelers winning a tied league record 6 Super Bowls. The Pittsburgh Panthers have also been successful in the NCAA with 9 national championships in football and 2 in basketball. The flag of Pittsburgh is colored with black and gold, based on the colors of William Pitt's coat of arms; Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States in which all professional sporting teams share the same colors. The city's first National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates, and that team's non-NHL predecessor, the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets, wore black and gold as their colors in the 1920s. The colors were adopted by founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Art Rooney, in 1933. In 1948, the Pittsburgh baseball Pirates switched their colors from red and blue to black and gold. Pittsburgh's second NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Penguins, wore blue and white, due to then-general manager Jack Riley's upbringing in Ontario. In 1979, after the Steelers and Pirates had each won their respective league championships, the Penguins altered their color scheme to match, despite objections from the Boston Bruins,[2][3] who have used the black and gold combination since the 1935–36 NHL season.[4][5] In 1975, late Steelers radio broadcaster Myron Cope invented the Terrible Towel, which has become ""arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team.""[6] Cope was one of multiple sports figures born in Pittsburgh and its surrounding area; others include golfer Arnold Palmer, Olympian and retired professional wrestler Kurt Angle, and basketball player Jack Twyman.  Pittsburgh is also sometimes called the ""Cradle of Quarterbacks""[7][8] due to the number of prominent players of that position who hail from the area, including NFL greats Jim Kelly, George Blanda, Johnny Unitas, Joe Namath, Dan Marino, and Joe Montana."

What additional liabilities does a person have when a suit is brought for the recovery of the Parking Tax?,"
            
            When a suit is brought for the recovery of the Parking Tax, the person liable therefor shall, in addition, be liable for the costs of collection and the penalties herein imposed.","     (d) Where  suit is brought  for the recovery  of the Parking Tax,  the person  liable therefor   shall,  in addition,  be liable for the costs  of collection , penalties,  and interest  herein   imposed.     (e) A person’s  belief  that no Parking  Tax is due and owing,  or the failure of  any person   to receive  or obtain the forms required  for making the returns  required  by the Code   is not a valid defense to  the imposition  of penalties  for violation herein.   Good  faith  shall not be a defense  to the imposition  of penalty.      ","     (6) The fines  and terms  of imprisonment  imposed  under  this Section  shall be in  addition  to any other  relief  granted  to the City of a monetary  nature   under the provisions  of these  Regulations.       § 604. SUITS  FOR  RECOVERY  OF UNPAID  TAXES.     The Treasurer may  sue in the name of  the City of Pittsburgh,  in law or in equity,  for the  recovery  of those  taxes  due and unpaid  under the provisions  of the Parking Tax,  to compel   the production of  records,  or to enforce  any other provisions  of the law.","     (c) Liability  of the  operator.   Any operator or provider required  under the Pittsburgh   Code,  Chapter 253  to collect  tax from a patron,  who shall  fail to collect  the tax, shall  be liable for the tax upon  the full  consideration received  from the patron or on his/her   behalf.     § 303.  RETURN  FORMS.     (a) Each  operator,  on forms  prescribed  by the Treasurer,  shall file by the fifteenth  day  of each month,  returns  for the preceding month  showing the consideration  received   with respect  to each  parking  place  during  the preceding  month  together  with the  amount  of tax due and collected thereon.  Any operator with  more  than one parking   place  shall file a separate  return  for each  individual  parking  place.  At the time of  filing the return,  the operator  shall pay to the Treasurer  all tax due  and collected for  the period to which  the return applies.","     (b) Proof of receipt.  If any claim  of overpayment  is made to the City of  Pittsburgh  after reported  Parking Tax was collected from but subsequently   refunded  to any patron;  for example,  the refunding of  any portion  of a prepaid  lease,  the operator  must  be able to provide  proof  that the patron received  the  refund  and that therefund amount  was properly  due and calculated.   No  refund or credit  shall be  claimed by an operator  if overpaid  amounts  are not  or cannot  be refunded  to the patrons  from whom they  were  originally   collected.  ","       (c) Where suit is brought for the  recovery of the usage fee, the Person  liable therefore shall, in addition, be liable for the costs of collection  and the penalties herein imposed.    A Person’s belief that no usage  fee is due and owing, or the failure of any such Person to receive or  obtain the forms required for making the returns required by the Code  is not a valid defense to the imposition of penalties for violation  herein.  Good faith shall not be a defense to the imposition of penalty."

What arrangements were made to ensure independent investigations of officer-involved shootings and in-custody deaths?,"

            The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) is independently investigating the incident with the full cooperation of the PBP. 

            Additionally, the Allegheny County Police Department is conducting a separate investigation into the incident. 

            Both investigations are being conducted in an independent and thorough manner to ensure that all facts and evidence are carefully considered and evaluated in order to reach accurate and just conclusions regarding the incident.","  PITTSBURGH, PA, (December 21, 2021) – On Wednesday, October 13, 2021, Jim Rogers was placed in Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) custody after officers responded to a call in Bloomfield. The officer on scene deployed his Taser during the response. Following his arrest, Mr. Rogers was transported to Mercy Hospital by police, where he passed away the following day.   Pursuant to policy, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police empaneled an internal Critical Incident Review Board (CIRB) to evaluate officers’ actions and gauge policy compliance. Additionally, the Allegheny County Police Department is independently investigating the incident with the full cooperation of the PBP. Over the course of two months, the CIRB has reviewed evidence including all available video, officer statements and Pittsburgh Bureau of Police general orders and training. The Board found that a series of procedural failures contributed to this tragic outcome.   Eight Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers, including two supervisors, will face varying levels of discipline in accordance with the Fraternal Order of Police collective bargaining agreement. We are not permitted to discuss details of the disciplinary process. 
  
 In recent years, the City of Pittsburgh implemented several measures to ensure accountability, including mandatory de-escalation and implicit bias training for officers and participation in The National Initiative for Building Community Trust & Justice, which examines policy and aims to increase trust within our community.  However, it is clear more needs to be done.   Therefore, the CIRB recommended the following policy and procedural changes:  ","    Detectives relied on video evidence, ballistic evidence, cell phone analysis and social media analysis as part of the investigation. In addition, multiple witness statements were obtained by PBP detectives in locations across the country. The investigation revealed that the two violent groups -- “Zhoove” from Beltzhoover and “Darccide” from St. Clair Village -- engaged in an all-out turf war that included gang members placing bounties of up to $20,000 on the heads of rival gang leaders. Omar Hodges was a victim of this senseless battle. He had no gang affiliation. He was an innocent, hard-working man who was killed while sitting in his car and waiting to go to work simply because his car resembled the vehicle of a high-ranking gang leader. Four of the suspects arrested -- Lance Gardenhire, Chris Brown, Holman Brown and Corey Cheatom -- have been charged with homicide in Hodges’ death. These arrests illustrate that Pittsburgh Police do not rest on open investigations. Years may pass. But detectives continue to question and push for answers. The results of this investigation come from excellent collaboration between Homicide detectives, Narcotics detectives, the Intelligence Unit and Zone 3 detectives. This investigation also shows the importance of investigators receiving help from the public. When witnesses come forward, we solve crimes. Thanks to the cooperation of the public, nine dangerous people are in custody and facing significant prison sentences. Many agencies played a hand in this investigation, including: The Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, The US Attorneys Office, The Allegheny County Crime Lab.","  21/9/2017 06:33:22   NON-FATAL SHOOTING UNDER INVESTIGATION  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  PITTSBURGH, PA – The Group Violence Intervention Unit is investigating the non-fatal shooting of two females who arrived at AGH by private means. According to the investigation, at approximately 10:43 p.m. on Wednesday, September 20, Officers were notified that a female arrived at the hospital with a grazing wound to her arm. Minutes later a second female arrived also with a grazing wound to her arm. Both females' injuries were minor. It is believed that the incident resulted from a fight earlier in the day in the 1300 block of Wood Run. The investigation is ongoing. There are no additional details available at this point.  ###","Investigations Branch  - The Investigations Branch provides dedicated law enforcement support to the  investigation and clearance of crimes against persons and property.
