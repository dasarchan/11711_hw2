What phone number should be included on a pet's identification tag?," The phone number that should be included on a pet's identification tag is the phone number of the pet owner. This will ensure that if someone finds the lost pet, they can easily contact the owner to reunite them with their beloved pet.","  Be proactive! Nobody expects a pet to go missing, so your pet should always wear a collar with an ID tag that has your phone number on it. Check the tag regularly to ensure it is still readable. Have your pet spayed or neutered. In addition to all the health benefits, it decreases an animal's desire to roam away from home. Pittsburgh residents are eligible for the City's free spay/neuter program for up to 5 pets! Check out the Spay/Neuter Program tab for an application and details. Get your pet microchipped this permanent form of ID can't be detached or obscured. Local shelters offer microchips at reduced rates. Make sure to keep your information updated with the microchip company if you move or get a new phone number Take photos of your pet (as if we had to ask you to do that!). Be sure to keep a few current ones on hand for emergency purposes If your pet has gotten away from you, call the local shelters. The open door shelter in Pittsburgh is Humane Animal Rescue at 412-345-7300. You need to file a lost report with them in case someone finds your pet. However, because descriptions may vary (you might call your dog tan while a shelter worker calls him yellow), it is best to visit the shelters in person. Making a flyer complete with color photos of your pet will help! You can bring a copy of the flyer to local shelters, post flyers around your neighborhood, and post the information to social media sites. Any animal picked up by Pittsburgh Animal Care and Control is taken to the Animal Rescue League, so if you've filed your lost report with them, you are covered if your pet is picked up by our officers","  In response to recent incidents of concern in the City regarding animals and wildlife, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is announcing a new resource for the public to address animal welfare complaints and concerns.  The Bureau has created a central email address where citizens and officers can send information or ask questions of its Animal Law Team.   The email address is: Animal.Law@pittsburghpa.gov. The messages will go directly to Animal Law Team members within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.  “We want to ensure that no concerns regarding the welfare and safety of the City’s animal population go unaddressed,” says Pittsburgh Police Lieutenant, Julie Stoops.  From Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich, ""Protecting pets and wildlife in our city is everyone's responsibility and reflects on who we are as Pittsburghers. Pittsburgh Police want to make it easy for citizens to give a voice to the voiceless by reporting any issues of concern about their welfare and safety so they can be addressed."" As always, all emergencies should be immediately reported to 9-1-1. ","  Any dogs running loose will be picked up and impounded by Police and Animal Control officers Licensed dogs and ID tagged cats: The owner will be contacted, and the animal will be held for 10 days at the Humane Animal Rescue - East End at the corner of Hamilton and Dallas Avenues in Homewood. The owner of the pet may claim his animal after paying for costs and charges paid by the City for picking up and taking care of the animal. Animals may be adopted or euthanized after 10 days following the notification of the owner.

Fan support was so low by the team's first bankruptcy that the NHL had no problem with the team being moved, something that would change decades later when the team faced another relocation threat. While the drafting of Mario Lemieux piqued interest in hockey locally, fans remained skeptical. John Steigerwald, brother of former Penguins broadcaster Paul Steigerwald,[98] noted in his autobiography that upon his arrival at KDKA-TV from WTAE-TV in 1985, the station cared more about the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League than the Penguins.[99] However, Lemieux's play steadily grew the fanbase in the area, which would only be reassured upon the arrival of Sidney Crosby after the team struggled both on the ice and in attendance following the Jaromir Jagr trade. Today, the Penguins are one of the NHL's most popular teams, especially among American non-Original Six franchises, and are considered second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams, taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates struggles both on and off the field.[100] Especially notable was a 2007 survey done of the four major sports leagues' 122 teams. The Penguins surprised observers by being ranked 20th overall and third among NHL teams, while the Steelers were ranked number one and the Pirates (before the arrival of Andrew McCutchen and that team's turnaround)[101] ranked much lower on the list than its peers. The Penguins' popularity has at times rivaled that of the Steelers at the local level.[102]","  Fanbase[edit] Bing Crosby co-owned the Pirates from 1946 until his death in 1977. Even though they have had some notable fans including former part-owner Bing Crosby, Michael Keaton, and Regis Philbin,[107] the Pirates are considered by most to be a distant third in Pittsburgh behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Penguins in popularity among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams.[108] However, due to their long history in Pittsburgh dating back to the 1882 season, the team has retained a strong loyal following in the Pittsburgh region, especially among older residents. Upon the team ending their 20-season losing season streak with a winning season in 2013, the fan support for the club has grown once again but still remaining a distant third behind the city's other 2 more successful franchises in the last half-century. While the team's recent struggles compared to Pittsburgh's other two teams can be partly to blame (since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979, the Steelers have won the Super Bowl 3 times (XIV, XL, and XLIII) and the Penguins the Stanley Cup five times in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017, including both in 2009), distractions off the field have also caused the team's popularity to slip in the city. While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s,[109] the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985 and two relocation threats since are believed to have also seen the team's popularity dipped.[110] The team's standing among fans has, however, improved along with the team on the field and the opening of PNC Park in 2001.[111] Following the Andrew McCutchen trade in 2018, fan relations have deteriorated despite the Pirates contending for the NL Central during 2018 due to backlash towards owner Robert Nutting, with the team ranking 27th among 30 MLB team in attendance that season.[112] When the Penguins won the Stanley Cup in 2009 captain Sidney Crosby brought the cup to PNC Park on the Sunday following the team's victory in Detroit. When they won again in 2017 the cup was once again brought to PNC Park and the team threw out the first pitch. The team won the cup in 1992 and they held a celebration in the Pirates' old home Three Rivers Stadium.","  ^ ""Penguins File For Chapter 11"". CBS News. October 14, 1998.

In the spring of 1965, Jack McGregor, a state senator from Kittanning, Pennsylvania, began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that included H. J. Heinz Company heir H. J. Heinz III, Pittsburgh Steelers' owner Art Rooney and the Mellon family's Richard Mellon Scaife. The projected league expansion depended on securing votes from the then-current NHL owners; to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from James D. Norris, owner of the Chicago Black Hawks and his brother Bruce Norris, owner of the Detroit Red Wings. The effort was successful, and on February 8, 1966, the National Hockey League awarded an expansion team to Pittsburgh for the 1967–68 season. The Penguins paid $2.5 million ($24.5 million today) for their entry and $750,000 ($7.1 million today) more for start-up costs. The Civic Arena's capacity was boosted from 10,732 to 12,500 to meet the NHL requirements for expansion. The Penguins also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings, which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise. The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer, and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL's Board of Governors.[5][6]"
What replaced the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility?,"

            The UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, located in suburban Cranberry Township near the interchange between Interstate 79 and Pennsylvania Route 228, replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility.

            The twin rink facility opened on August 16, 2015, and combined a new team practice and training facility with a UPMC Sports Medicine treatment and research complex.

            Since then, the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex has served as the Penguins' regular practice facility, freeing up the Consol Energy Center for other events on days the Penguins are not scheduled to play.

            The goal horn at the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex is used to celebrate both team goals and victories during home games. It is also played just before the beginning of a home game and after a Penguins victory.

            The current goal horn made by Nathan Manufacturing, Inc., was introduced in 2005 to coincide with Sidney Crosby joining the team. It replaced the previous goal horn that had been in use since the late 1980s or early 1990s.

            The UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex has also served as the practice facility for the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, the American Hockey League affiliate of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

            In addition to serving as the regular practice facility for both the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex also hosts various other hockey events and tournaments throughout the year. These events include local youth hockey games and tournaments, high school hockey games and tournaments, and various other amateur and professional hockey events and tournaments.

            Overall, the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex has become an integral part of the Pittsburgh Penguins organization and the greater hockey community in the Pittsburgh area and beyond. Its state-of-the-art facilities and commitment to excellence have helped to foster a culture of success and innovation within the Pittsburgh Penguins organization and the broader hockey community.

            In conclusion, the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex has replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the regular practice facility for the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. Its state-of-the-art facilities and commitment to excellence have helped to foster a culture of success and innovation within the Pittsburgh Penguins organization and the broader hockey community.","  The UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex under construction in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania, in April 2015. The complex opened in August 2015, and is used by the Penguins as their practice facility. From 1995 to 2015, the IceoPlex at Southpointe in the South Hills suburbs served as the team's practice facility. Robert Morris University's 84 Lumber Arena has served as a secondary practice facility for the team. During the franchise's first pre-season training camp and pre-season exhibition games, the Brantford Civic Centre in Brantford, Ontario, served as its home,[92] and by the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, the team was using the suburban Rostraver Ice Garden for training. In August 2015, the Penguins and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) opened the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, combining a new team practice and training facility with a UPMC Sports Medicine treatment and research complex, in suburban Cranberry Township near the interchange between Interstate 79 and Pennsylvania Route 228.[93] The twin rink facility replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility, freeing up the Consol Energy Center for other events on days the Penguins are not scheduled to play.[94] As with most other NHL arenas, the Penguins make use of a goal horn whenever the team scores a goal at home. It is also played just before the beginning of a home game, and after a Penguins victory. Their current goal horn made by Nathan Manufacturing, Inc. and introduced in 2005 to coincide with Sidney Crosby joining the team, was used at both the Civic Arena and the Consol Energy Center.[95][96]","  Hockey[edit] The NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins have played in Pittsburgh since the team's founding in 1967. The team has won 6 Eastern Conference titles (1991, 1992, 2008, 2009, 2016 and 2017) and 5 Stanley Cup championships (1991, 1992, 2009, 2016 and 2017). Since 1999, Hall of Famer and back-to-back playoff MVP Mario Lemieux has served as Penguins owner. Until moving into the PPG Paints Arena in 2010 (when it was known as Consol Energy Center), the team played their home games at the world's first retractable domed stadium, the Civic Arena, or in local parlance ""The Igloo"".[212] Ice hockey has had a regional fan base since the 1890s semi-pro Keystones. The city's first ice rink dates back to 1889, when there was an ice rink at the Casino in Schenley Park. From 1896 to 1956, the Exposition Building on the Allegheny River near The Point and Duquesne Gardens in Oakland offered indoor skating.[213] The NHL awarded one of its first franchises to the city in 1924 on the strength of the back-to-back USAHA championship-winning Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates made several Stanley Cup playoff runs before folding from Great Depression financial pressures. Hockey survived with the Pittsburgh Hornets farm team (1936–1967) and their seven finals appearances and three championships in 18 playoff seasons. Robert Morris University fields a Division I college hockey team at the Island Sports Center. Pittsburgh has semi-pro and amateur teams such as the Pittsburgh Penguins Elite.[214] Pro-grade ice rinks in the region include the Rostraver Ice Garden and Iceoplex at Southpointe.",    Pittsburgh Penguins - Wikipedia                                    Jump to content        Main menu      Main menu move to sidebar hide      Navigation     Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact us        Contribute     HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload fileSpecial pages                    Search            Search                       Appearance                 Donate  Create account  Log in         Personal tools      Donate Create account Log in        Pages for logged out editors learn more    ContributionsTalk                             Contents move to sidebar hide     (Top)      1 History     Toggle History subsection      1.1 Early years (1967–1984)       1.1.1 Triumph of playoff berths and tragedy of Briere (1969–1974)         1.1.2 Playoff runs and a uniform change (1974–1982)           1.2 Lemieux–Jagr era (1984–2005)       1.2.1 Back-to-back Stanley Cup titles (1989–1997)         1.2.2 Lemieux's retirement and return (1997–2001),"   The Civic Arena's capacity was increased to meet NHL requirements for a franchise. The arena served as the Penguins' home arena from 1967 to 2010. A contest was held where 700 of 26,000 entries picked ""Penguins"" as the team's nickname, sharing its nickname with the athletic department of the newly named Youngstown State University in nearby Youngstown, Ohio. (Youngstown is part of the Penguins' territorial rights to this day, though they did briefly share them with the Cleveland Barons in the mid-1970s.) Mark Peters had the winning entry (which was inspired because the team was to play in the ""Igloo"", the nickname of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena),[7][8] a logo was chosen that had a penguin in front of a triangle, which symbolized the ""Golden Triangle"" of downtown Pittsburgh.[7][9] The Penguins' first general manager, Jack Riley, opened the first pre-season camp for the franchise in Brantford, Ontario,[10] on September 13, 1967, playing the franchise's first exhibition match in Brantford against the Philadelphia Flyers on September 23, 1967. Restrictive rules which kept most major talent with the existing ""Original Six"" teams hampered the Penguins, along with the rest of the expansion teams. Beyond aging sniper Andy Bathgate, all-star defenseman Leo Boivin (who had begun his professional career with the Hornets) and New York Rangers' veteran Earl Ingarfield, a cast of former minor leaguers largely manned the first Penguins' team. Several players played for the Hornets the previous season: Bathgate, wingers Val Fonteyne and Ab McDonald, and goaltenders Hank Bassen and Joe Daley. George Sullivan was named the head coach for the club's first two seasons, and McDonald was named the team's first captain.[11] On October 11, 1967, league president Clarence Campbell and McGregor jointly dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins' opening home game against the Montreal Canadiens.[5] On October 21, 1967, they became the first team from the expansion class to defeat an Original Six team, as they defeated the Chicago Black Hawks 4–2. However, the Penguins went 27–34–13 and finished in fifth place in the West Division, missing the playoffs and ending with the third-worst record in the league. The team's best player proved to be longtime Cleveland Barons AHL goaltender Les Binkley, who recorded a 2.88 goals-against average and was second in the league with six shutouts. Defensive winger Ken Schinkel won the team's sole league honor, being named to represent the Penguins in the NHL All-Star Game. Bathgate led the team in scoring with 59 points but retired at season's end. McDonald, who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring, was also gone at season's end, traded to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for center Lou Angotti.[6] The next season saw the team slip in the standings amid a sharp drop in form by Binkley, into sixth place and with the league's worst record. Several changes were made to improve the team, resulting in Boivin and several others being traded, and new players – including longtime future Penguins star Jean Pronovost – making their debuts. No captain was named to replace McDonald; the team went with four alternate captains.","  ^ ""Pittsburgh Penguins Start With Many Goalies on Team"". Observer-Reporter.

            On February 18, 2018, at approximately 3:30 a.m., there was a fatal two-vehicle accident at the intersection of Frankstown Road and Washington Boulevard in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. One male victim was found pinned under a vehicle and died at the scene.

     UPDATE: Police Investigate South Side Business Robberies","  PITTSBURGH, PA (August 19, 2021) – Following the partial collapse of a building located at 1604 E. Carson Street on August 12, engineers have been working to stabilize two adjacent buildings in order for the demolition of the affected structure to begin. During this week, E. Carson St. between S. 16th and S.17th Streets has been closed to vehicle and pedestrian traffic. After a successful stabilization and demolition, vehicle and pedestrian traffic resumed this afternoon. Barricades on the sidewalk and parking lane are still in place for the length of the affected structures. A reminder that Public Safety’s traffic pilot project implemented on July 30, and modified on August 12, will NOT be in effect for the time being.   19/8/2021 16:25:52   Pittsburgh Police Community Engagement Office Events for the Week of August 16 to August 22","  29/6/2021 17:11:35   Pittsburgh Police Enhance Safety and Security Measures in the South Side Business District  PITTSBURGH, PA (July 1, 2021) --- As COVID-19 mitigation measures continue to be lifted and businesses are back to full occupancy, large numbers of young people have returned to the South Side on the weekends and evenings to patronize the area's many bars and restaurants.   On East Carson Street, the increased volume of people has resulted in nearly impassable sidewalks, pedestrians flowing into the road amid traffic, and parked vehicles blocking safety lanes. There have also been fistfights, pedestrians struck by vehicles, and incidents of gun violence.   “While we are glad that Pittsburgh is returning to some semblance of normalcy since the height of the pandemic, the situation on the South Side has become dangerous and untenable,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. “First responder vehicles must have access to East Carson in case of an emergency and overcrowded sidewalks pose hazards to pedestrians who then spill onto the streets and into vehicle traffic. Without changes, someone is going to get seriously hurt or killed.”  In response, beginning Friday, July 2, 2021 and going forward, Pittsburgh Police will first be issuing warnings and then citations to those who obstruct public passageways. If violators fail to comply, there may be physical arrests. The citations could carry penalties of up to $300, plus court costs. Police motorcycle and bicycle units will also be in place to enforce parking. All vehicles in violation of the posted measures will be towed.  Public Safety encourages everyone to celebrate safely on the South Side, and throughout the City of Pittsburgh, and we wish you a happy and safe Fourth of July holiday weekend. "

Dec. 31 is traditionally a night that draws tens of thousands of people to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Highmark First Night Pittsburgh celebrations at venues throughout Downtown.  Not this year. Due to the pandemic, venues are closed, large gatherings are prohibited, fireworks have been cancelled and First Night has transformed into a made-for-TV-only event.  “I know that we all want—and absolutely deserve—to celebrate New Year’s Eve as we always do: With family and friends, with fireworks and with fanfare,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “That’s just not possible or responsible this year. Better times are certainly ahead, but we must maintain our resolve now in order to see this pandemic through to the end.”  Hissrich re-issued his traditional New Year’s Eve message, with a caveat: Celebrate responsibly—ideally at home—and do not engage in dangerous or illegal activities.  Such activities include shooting guns off in the air. What goes up will come down, and the results are tragic when people are hit by celebratory gunfire. Just last year, a woman in Texas was struck and killed by a descending bullet as she stood in her driveway to watch fireworks. There have been many other documented cases of celebratory gunfire killing innocent people. Police will monitor and respond to ShotSpotter activations throughout the city. Officers will arrest anyone caught discharging a firearm in public.  As a reminder, city law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of a structure. Never drink and drive. Officers will be actively looking for impaired motorists.  Lastly, please adhere to the Governor’s health regulations regarding Covid-19. Wear a mask, social distance and do not attend gatherings with people from outside of your home.  Be safe, Pittsburghers, as we rightfully banish 2020 to the ash heap of history and turn a hopeful eye to what might lie ahead.

The Shante Dream Arkive brings alive a mosaic of characters—all searching through history for something or someone lost to the island: a mother searches for her missing child through time and space; an undocumented migrant struggles with loss while living in the US; a youth wanders through dream-gates seeking liberation and the lost parts of himself.

What is the purpose of the Operating Budget according to the provided text?,"
            The Operating Budget, as described in the provided text, is a financial plan that outlines how the City of Pittsburgh intends to allocate and spend its revenue during a fiscal year. It serves as a tool for managing the city's resources effectively and efficiently while ensuring that essential services are maintained for the benefit of the city's residents.","What is the Operating Budget? The Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year. Reported within this document are  figures related to planned expenditures and projected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year. Expenditures are  spread across all City Departments, Bureaus, and Elected Offices. These expenditures represent costs for the  administration and distribution of governmental services. These services include, but are not limited to: public  safety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and  programming for local parks and community recreation centers. In addition, the General Fund also supports the  routine administration of local government that includes employee wages and health benefits, workers’  compensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service. The City collects revenues to finance the costs associated with delivering services to residents. Revenues are  collected by the City from the levy of taxes, collection of fees related to the issuance of permits and licenses,  charges for services provided by City Departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other  revenue generating mechanisms.  The Operating Budget combines information relating to expenditures and revenues, creating a plan as to what  governmental services can be executed by the City and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal  year. The detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in  delivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed. The Operating Budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the Mayor and  Members of City Council. Laws established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict how much money the  City of Pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses. As a result, the City of  Pittsburgh must balance the demands for services against the available resources that it can legally acquire  through tax and non-tax revenue generating mechanisms. Given the reality of scarce resources, the City must  prioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the  City. The level of funding allocated to individual Departments and programs within the City clearly exhibits  priorities set by the City’s elected public officials. Finally, the Operating Budget can be viewed as a legally binding document. All of the costs incurred by the City of  Pittsburgh in providing day-to-day public services must be paid for out of the Operating Budget. Therefore, the  City of Pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document. The Operating  Budget can only be altered through a series of formal processes, which parallel those enacted in the initial  creation of the plan. Basis of Accounting The General Fund budget is adopted on a cash basis of accounting, meaning that the City of Pittsburgh  recognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid. The Fiscal Year The City of Pittsburgh’s fiscal year begins on the first day of January and ends on the last day of December of  each year. This can only be changed by ordinance. Balanced Budget Mandate The City’s Home Rule Charter requires that the annual Operating Budget be balanced, with estimated revenues  equal to or greater than estimated expenditures. Should revenues exceed expenditures at the end of a fiscal year,  the budget surplus is transferred into the City’s reserve fund balance.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide 20","How to Read the Budget Throughout this budget document, financial data is illustrated in a variety of ways. In general, each separate  section of the document reports the same financial data. The level of detail is the only substantial difference  between each report within a section.  Departmental Sections The most detailed and specific illustration of the General Fund Operating Budget financial data can be found in  the Departmental Sections of the document. This section details funds by subclass and account that have been  appropriated to each individual division. The following are the different components that in aggregate make up the  Departmental Sections of the Operating Budget.

Five-Year Expenditure Forecast The 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan submitted by the City highlights the Mayor's commitment to  financial sustainability, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations, and strengthening  financial management practices. The City plans to achieve these by: • Eliminating operating deficits in the baseline financial projections while preserving core municipal services • Managing the City’s debt burden to provide more resources to support daily operations • Keeping the City’s fund balance at an appropriate level to avoid the need for cash flow borrowings and  provide an adequate buffer against unanticipated revenue shortfalls or expenditure increases • Maintaining the City’s pension fund contributions at levels recommended by its actuary The 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan provides a fiscally responsible path to address legacy costs and  improve the City’s long-term fiscal health by: • Allocating an additional $243 million to the pension fund over five years beyond the state mandated  minimum municipal obligation (MMO) to reach the actuarial recommended contribution (ARC) • Continuing efforts of responsible borrowing with the City’s debt burden totaling 10.1 percent of General  Fund expenditures in 2024 • Allocating a $22.0 million in ""pay-as-you-go"" (PAYGO) transfer to the capital improvement plan In addition to the information outlined in the revenue and expenditure sections of the budget document, key  components and assumptions incorporated into the forecast include the following: • Salaries & Wages: OMB will continue to work with departments to identify opportunities to increase  workplace productivity and implement other operational efficiencies as part of the enterprise cost  management initiative. • Employee Benefits: This category includes all health care costs for both active and retired employees,  workers' compensation costs, employer mandated costs such as social security, and employer  contributions to the pension fund. Health care costs are projected to rise over the course of the next few  years, but the City is working to improve its overall wellness program with the goal of improving employee City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget  Fiscal Year 2024 Expenditures 53","Expenditure Summary Fiscal Year 2024 Expenditures Expenditures total $684,553,037 in fiscal year 2024.

In total, these departments account  for 70.4 percent of total expenditures in the 2024 Operating Budget.

SHAKESPEARE SINGS AND LOVE WINS
If musicals be the food of love, let this groundbreaking adaptation of Shakespeare’s most cherished comedy play on! When noblewoman Viola finds herself shipwrecked, she decides to disguise herself as the male page Cesario to blend in. Her decision triggers literature’s most hilarious love triangle and inspires the people of Illyria to see life through the eyes of another. This production not only enchants with its catchy pop score but also introduces Pittsburgh to the transformative Public Works program. Through community collaboration, this theatrical marvel becomes a celebration that is truly for, by, and of the people. Revel in the magic of love, laughter, and fellowship in this unmissable spectacle.

Rated PG for mild swearing, crude humor, suggestive dialogue, violence, alcohol use, and themes of death and grief.

Public Works is made possible through the generous support of the Richard King Mellon Foundation.

A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe — from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists. In the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh. Today its global presence includes campuses in Qatar and Silicon Valley, Calif., more than a dozen degree-granting locations and more than 20 research partnerships such as Los Angeles; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Australia; China; Portugal and Rwanda.","  It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th century campus designed in the beaux arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories — the hands-on center of learning that persists today. It pioneered conservatory degree programs in music and drama, in addition to visual art and design programs. The first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech. It began offering graduate degrees. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China. It laid the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. It initiated the 'Carnegie Plan' in 1938, a new curriculum that required science and engineer students to take courses in humanities and social sciences in order to better understand the needs of society. Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him.","      External Higher Education Resources  Carlow University Carlow University provides a supportive environment where faculty and staff focus on helping students both academically and professionally.

Restaurant Week Tips
MAKE RESERVATIONS. Most locations accept reservations during restaurant week to streamline their customer service. For restaurants that do not offer online reservations, call to inquire about a dining time.
MENTION RESTAURANT WEEK. When being seated and offered menus, ensure to mention Pittsburgh Restaurant Week to the waitstaff to ensure you are getting the correct menus and pricing.
GRATUITIES APPRECIATED. Waitstaff handle a surge of customers during restaurant week and many of the special menus are multiple courses that would have been priced higher if ordered a la carte. If you are able, consider gratuities that take into account the original pricing and extra effort to perfect a multi-course service.

In what year did the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh first begin playing as a founding member of the American Association?,"1882
            
            Explanation: The context provided states that the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh first began playing as a founding member of the American Association in 1882.","   History[edit] Main article: History of the Pittsburgh Pirates Professional baseball in the Pittsburgh area began in 1876 with the organization of the Allegheny Base Ball Club, an independent (non-league) club based in a then-separate city called Allegheny City, across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. The team joined the minor league International Association in 1877, only to fold the following season.[8] On October 15, 1881, Denny McKnight held a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club,[9] which began play in 1882 as a founding member of the American Association. Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh,[10] the team was listed as ""Allegheny"" in the standings, and was sometimes called the ""Alleghenys"" (rarely the ""Alleghenies"") in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887.[11]","   ^ ""Charter of Incorporation of Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pgh. Penna.""

© 2025 The Andy Warhol Museum","            A League of Their Own Watch on Prime Video. If you build it, they will come. I know that's the wrong baseball movie, but that premise is what helped Pittsburgh land the new ""A League of Their Own"" adaptation released summer 2022. The CCAC Boyce campus received a whole new ballpark out of the deal that is now their home field! Other Pittsburgh locations to keep an eye out for are the Carrie Blast Furnaces and Benedum Center, and eagle-eyed viewers should be able to pick out the stretch of South Side that was brilliantly converted into a 1940s location.            The Andy Warhol Diaries Watch on Netflix. Dive into the purposefully unknowable personal life of Andy Warhol through his diaries (recited by a Warhol Foundation-approved AI recreating his voice) and those that knew him best. This series shot extensively in The Andy Warhol Museum and spent a lot of time in the archives and speaking to curators to make sure they captured Andy as faithfully as possible.","What They Say, What They Said

Dandy Andy: Warhol’s Queer History
A black and white photograph shows Andy Warhol from the chest up in drag, wearing a short coiffed brown wig, heavy face powder, black eyeliner, and dark red lipstick. He turns his head slightly and stares at the camera, with a loose white blouse unbuttoned at the neck.

Join artist educators for Dandy Andy, a monthly tour that focuses on Warhol’s queer history. While his sexuality is frequently suppressed or debated, Warhol was a gay man who had several partners throughout his life. Warhol’s boyfriends, including Edward Wallowitch, John Giorno, and Jed Johnson, were also his colleagues and collaborators, helping to shape and define his career as an artist. This tour traces Warhol’s romantic relationships and queer identity against the backdrop of the historical gay rights movement in the United States. Tours meet on the museum’s seventh floor.

What department handles Emergency Management and Homeland Security?, The Pittsburgh Office of Emergency Management & Homeland Security (OEHMS) is the department responsible for handling Emergency Management and Homeland Security in the City of Pittsburgh.,What is the department responsible for Emergency Management and Homeland Security?,"Mission The mission of the Department of Public Safety is to provide for the security and safety of all residents and  patrons of the City of Pittsburgh through the oversight and execution of the public safety operational strategies  through the planned and coordinated efforts of the Bureaus of Police (PBP), Fire (PBF), Emergency Medical  Services (EMS), and Animal Care and Control (ACC). This mission includes the creation of a command team with  representatives from PBP, PBF, and EMS acting in conjunction as the Office of Emergency Management (OEM).  We strive to improve community and first responder safety through integrated response, training, technology, fleet  upgrades, and increased community visibility as well as enhancing and enforcing team collaboration across all  Public Safety Bureaus. We attempt to further our mission through the streamlining of administrative positions to  provide cross training support, and improve oversight on resources, spending, and hiring practices. Departmental/Bureau Overview Administration  - The Bureau of Administration contains the Office of the Director of the Department of Public  Safety. It is a managed entity responsible for standardizing practices, policies, response efforts, technology, and  communication between all bureaus. It provides oversight and inter-bureau coordination of personnel, resources,  facilities, and finances. While each of the bureaus remain independent, the Department has streamlined uniform  policies, reporting structures, and financial management. Community Outreach  - The Office of Community Outreach serves as a liaison between the City of Pittsburgh’s  residents and community groups and the Department of Public Safety. The Community Outreach staff is  responsible for coordinating and maintaining numerous Public Safety community relations initiatives. In an effort  to keep residents safe and improve their quality of life, the Outreach staff educates and provides the public with  general safety, crime prevention, and various life enhancing resources. These initiatives are conducted through  meetings, workshops, and community sponsored events. The Department of Public Safety Community Outreach  efforts can be classified into four categories - Safer Together Pittsburgh, Youth Policy, Victim Assistance, and the  Ranger program.","  History The origins of the Pittsburgh Office of Emergency Management & Homeland Security (OEMHS) began in 1986 within its predecessor office, the Office of Safety and Inspections. The first emergency planner within this office was Raymond Demichiei. Tasked by former Pittsburgh Public Safety Director, Glenn Cannon to write an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) for the EMS service, Demichiei created the first official emergency planning document for the City of Pittsburgh. In the late 1980’s following an initiative from the Commonwealth to address disaster emergencies, funding became available through the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Assistance Project for the official formation of emergency management agencies within Pennsylvania. These emergency management agencies would be responsible for activities involving protection, mitigation, response, and recovery operations for major metropolitan cities. With this new influx of funding, the Pittsburgh Emergency Management Agency (EMA) was officially formed in 1988 with Director Cannon as Emergency Management Coordinator and Demichiei as Deputy Director. The first major investment utilizing the new emergency management funding came in 1996 with the creation of the first City of Pittsburgh Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The EOC would serve as the central hub for information sharing and decision making for all significant incidents within the City. That same year came the first EOC activation, occurring in response to the Flood of 1996. In 1998 came the formation of the Southwestern Emergency Response Task Force comprised of the emergency management agencies of the 13 counties of Southwestern Pennsylvania and the City of Pittsburgh. This new task force, renamed the Region 13 Task Force, united all response and training assets within the region for the purpose of mutual aid, enhanced training capabilities, sharing critical infrastructure protection activities, and as a formal organization for the sharing of emergency management funding provided by federal and state resources. The task force funding also allowed for the hiring of two emergency planning staff members which were allocated to Pittsburgh EMA, becoming the first emergency management planners for the City. Following the 9/11 attacks came the establishment of the federal Department of Homeland Security (DHS). With the release of the DHS National Preparedness Goal initiative, it was recognized that Homeland Security begins with Hometown Security. As such, the Pittsburgh Emergency Management Agency expanded its mission area to include Homeland Security and altered the name of the organization to the Pittsburgh Office of Emergency Management & Homeland Security (OEMHS). The post 9/11 era also brought new federal preparedness and response funding for state and local agencies through the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP). Through this program, Pittsburgh OEMHS was able to purchase various vehicles and equipment to fill response gaps created from the newly evolving threat landscape. These pieces of equipment and vehicles helped enhance operational abilities and address capability gaps within the City and Region. Pittsburgh was a pioneer in many pieces of equipment including the creation of the state of the art Pierce/LDV Mobile Command Post equipped with the latest technology to function as a free standing 911 center. The Bomb Squad received a new response vehicle and a remote controlled robot with capabilities not previously integrated into such equipment. A Lenco fully armored response vehicle was put into service in order to better protect SWAT officers responding to hostile events. The K-9 team received a first-of-its-kind vehicle capable of responding with up to eight teams and functioning as a base of operations. River Rescue took delivery of a second SeaArk rescue craft to enhance water borne capabilities. A new Hazmat response vehicle and a Mass Casualty unit were also placed in service. All of these vehicles and equipment are designated for regional response to any county in need throughout the Region 13 Task Force area. Today, Pittsburgh OEMHS continues to be the conduit for planning, coordination, and information sharing between the public and private sector in the mission areas of protection, prevention, mitigation, response, and recovery.",Department of Public Safety 154,"  PITTSBURGH, PA (January 31, 2022) – Pittsburgh Public Safety is pleased to announce that Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief Darryl Jones has been appointed as the Emergency Management Coordinator for the City of Pittsburgh.  Jones will supervise the Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (OEHMS) in addition to his duties as Chief with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire, a position he’s held since 2007.   Chief Jones is uniquely qualified for the OEHMS Coordinator role with credentials as a PA Certified Municipal Emergency Management Professional, a member of the Pennsylvania All-Hazards Incident Management Team, and a U.S Department of Homeland Security Type-3 Incident Commander and Planning Section Chief.  He also holds a doctorate in Public Safety with a specialty in Emergency Management from Capella University.  Congratulations Chief Jones!  "

It’s a foodie heaven that is authentic and bursting with local flavor. A trip to the ‘Burgh isn’t complete without a Primanti Brothers signature sandwich. This sandwich - or as some locals say, sammich - is topped with French fries, secret recipe coleslaw and fresh tomatoes, and has been featured in every Food Network show imaginable. Other Pittsburgh staples include Pamela’s Diner, Roland’s Seafood Grill and The Beerhive!","           Credit |MancinisBread on Insta       Stop #8: Drink Something Local  Time Elapsed: 1 hour, 59 minutes In my opinion, you can't leave the city without tasting something local brewed right here. La Prima Espresso and De Fer Coffee & Tea are great stops any time of day, and craft breweries Bonafide Beer Co. and Helltown are right here to sip at their taprooms along with bars and restaurants all through this area serving local favorites.  Pay your tab, and make your way to your final stop in the Strip and on this tour.         Credit |beansintheburgh on Insta       To-Go: Primanti Bros.  Stop the Clock Brooklyn has Mario and Luigi, Pittsburgh has the Primanti Brothers. Here, the fries go on the sandwich along with their secret recipe coleslaw for a unique Pittsburgh dish that started right at this location and has now spread throughout the city, region and even country. If you've timed this right, your Uber back to Pittsburgh International should be picking you up just as you get your to-go order from Primanti Bros. Ran out of time? No worries, there's a Primantis location in the airport as well for the best, most portable meal you're going to find while traveling.","            Insider Tip: You can also get these same signature fries at the Small Fry's booth in Old Kennywood (also noted on the map above), usually with shorter lines! Kennywood's sister parks, Sandcastle and Idlewild & Soak Zone, also serves up these spectacular spuds.      Primanti's | A Pittsburgh Favorite  Located in Old Kennywood, Primanti's celebrated its 90th birthday by opening their first-ever location inside a theme park back in 2023! While the menu is scaled down from their full-service restaurant, crowd favorites like the Pittsburger, pastrami and my go-to capicola are all there, loaded with their signature coleslaw and fresh-cut fries. Besides getting an authentic taste of Pittsburgh at the park, I also love this location because the tables here are plentiful and tucked under a shady grove of trees. It's the perfect place to fuel up midday before getting back to the action!"

What initiative was launched in 2016 to plant redbud trees and other native trees along Pittsburgh's rivers?, The Pittsburgh Redbud Project was launched in 2016 to plant thousands of redbuds and other native trees alongside Pittsburgh's three rivers.,"                      Redbuds in bloom       Redbuds - The Pittsburgh Cherry Blossom  Think of the redbud as the Only in Pittsburgh variant of the popular cherry blossoms seen in D.C. or throughout Japan. Redbuds are known for their iconic bursts of rosy pink flowers and leaves that change from reddish-purple to green to yellow from spring to fall.  The Pittsburgh Redbud Project, an initiative of the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, launched in 2016 to plant thousands of these and other native trees alongside our three rivers to help beautify but also aid the local wildlife. Redbud blossoms draw in butterflies and honey bees, and songbirds love eating the seeds and nesting in their canopies. Fun Fact: George Washington loved redbuds and transplanted as many as he could from the forest to his property, writing frequently about the tree in his diary.","

What is Knotzland Bowties' approach to product creation and what impact has it achieved?,"

            Knotzland Bowties' approach to product creation is unique and sustainable. They design custom bowties using textile discards that would otherwise end up in landfills. By reusing these materials, they not only reduce waste but also create stylish and one-of-a-kind accessories. Their commitment to sustainability and innovation has made Knotzland Bowties a beloved and respected brand in the fashion industry.","          Designing and redesigning products made from its own post-production materials, Knotzland Bowties creates low-waste, high-fashion bowties and other sustainable treasures. Founded by Nisha Blackwell, Knotzland has rescued more than 3,400 pounds of fabric and offset 11,000 pounds of carbon emissions while creating vibrant, wearable art. Also supporting the community is Pip & Lola’s Everything Homemade, which donates one bar of soap to domestic violence shelters and charities for every two items purchased. Pip & Lola’s Everything Homemade specializes in handcrafted vegan and vegetarian scented body bars, facial soaps and solid shampoo bars.","           Knotzland Bowtie Co.

The 2025 History Maker Honorees will be announced soon – check this space for updates!

The 32nd annual History Makers Award Dinner, presented by BNY, will take place on Thursday, June 5, at the Heinz History Center.



Since 1992, the Heinz History Center has honored exceptional individuals whose accomplishments, while rooted here in Western Pa., transcend geographic bounds. History Makers profoundly contribute to the innovative history and collective heritage of our region and represent a commitment to excellence that has defined our community. The History Center is proud to celebrate such individuals and to share their remarkable stories.

Funding raised from the Award Dinner helps to preserve our regional history for future generations and provide a space where experiences and learning moments for all ages help make memories that last a lifetime. The History Center tells the stories of Western Pennsylvanians whose hard work, innovation, enterprise, creativity, and courage improved the world and still serves to guide and inspire us today. Like our History Makers, we are encouraged (but not surprised) by stories of Pittsburgh’s can-do spirit and kindness. After all—we are home to “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.”

PBF invites girls between 15 and 18 years old to jumpstart their career as firefighters and community leaders by learning alongside experienced women in the field.  Only 20 applicants will be selected for the inaugural camp and all applicants must be residents of the City of Pittsburgh.   Participants will get a well-rounded, real-life look at what it takes to become a firefighter while learning about topics that will fuel empowerment such as fitness and nutrition, emergency medical care, fire science leadership and self-confidence.  “Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire recognized the need to close the gender gap that currently exists by confronting gender stereotypes and encouraging women to seek out the fire service as a viable career option. Firefighters engage with the entire community, so bringing in people of different backgrounds, genders and perspectives enhances our department's ability to better service our city,” said Fire Inspector and Fire Prevention Officer Lisa Epps-Cuda.  “Our hope is that this camp’s focus on encouraging and empowering young women reflects an effort to change a profession in which women are under-represented. We aim to shift the existing trend from traditional “boys’ club” to one that is inclusive to women and minorities.”  The application deadline is August 8, 2022. Applicants will be notified of acceptance by August 12.  The application can be accessed here.

"What changes are being implemented to traffic flow on East Carson Street beginning August 12, 2021?","

            Beginning August 12, 2021, East Carson Street will undergo several changes to traffic flow. These changes are being implemented in response to concerns regarding overcrowded sidewalks and street traffic.

            Beginning at 7pm on Fridays and Saturdays, East Carson Street will convert from two-way traffic to one-way traveling eastbound between S. 11th and S. 17th. This change is being implemented to help reduce congestion and improve safety for pedestrians and drivers alike.

            Only emergency vehicles and Port Authority buses will be allowed to travel in both directions on East Carson Street during the hours of 7pm to 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. This restriction is being put in place to help ensure that emergency responders are able to reach their destinations quickly and efficiently, without being hindered by heavy traffic congestion.

            Ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft will not be permitted to stop on East Carson Street between S. 10th and S. 18th Streets during the hours of 7pm to 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. This restriction is being put in place to help ensure that ride-sharing services are able to pick up and drop off passengers efficiently, without causing unnecessary congestion or hindering emergency responders from reaching their destinations quickly and efficiently.

            Parking and deliveries will be prohibited on either side of East Carson Street between 7pm and 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. This restriction is being put in place to help ensure that parking and delivery activities do not contribute to unnecessary congestion or hinder emergency responders from reaching their destinations quickly and efficiently.

            Side streets from S. 11th to S. 17th inclusive will be closed to traffic during the hours of 7pm to 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. This closure is being put in place to help ensure that side streets do not contribute to unnecessary congestion or hinder emergency responders from reaching their destinations quickly and efficiently.

            Only residents will be allowed to enter these areas during the hours of 7pm to 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. This restriction is being put in place to help ensure that side streets do not contribute to unnecessary congestion or hinder emergency responders from reaching their destinations quickly and efficiently, while also ensuring that residents are able to access their properties during these hours.

            All feedback is welcomed to the City 3-1-1 Response Center (Dial 311 or 412-255-2621). The 9-1-1 system should always be used for emergencies.

            We appreciate everyone’s patience during this second weekend of adjustments. Areas designated with No Parking signs will be heavily enforced. The Department of Public Safety recognizes the slight inconvenience, but the overall goal of increased safety, overcrowded sidewalks and street traffic needed to be addressed.","  20/8/2021 15:35:36   Public Safety to Reinstate Modified Traffic Pilot Project on the South Side  PITTSBURGH, PA, (August 25, 2021) – After a temporary delay due to a partial building collapse in the 1600 block of E. Carson St. on August 12, the Department of Public Safety is reestablishing its modified traffic pilot project on the South Side this upcoming weekend, August 27 – August 29. The primary intent of the plan has been to stem the flow of vehicle traffic into the commercial corridor to alleviate some of the density in the area during the busiest evening hours on the weekends.  Ongoing discussion with business owners and residents has resulted in slight adjustments to the plan to ensure ease of access to restaurants and retail stores in the early evening hours.   Public Safety has made modifications to the times of day during which the measures will be implemented.  Beginning at 9:30 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, East Carson Street will convert from two-way to one-way traffic traveling eastbound (outbound) between S. 10th and S. 18th. The previous start time was 7:00 p.m.    On Fridays and Saturdays, 'No Parking' measures will be strictly enforced on these blocks of East Carson Street starting at 8 p.m., including the towing of vehicles, to keep this stretch clear for Public Safety vehicle access. Signage along East Carson will be clearly marked to reflect the altered parking hours for these days.  Side streets from S.11th to S.17th will remain open to through-traffic until 9:30 p.m., at which time vehicles will be diverted around those streets via either Muriel Street or Sarah Street. In previous weeks, the side streets were closed at 7:00 p.m.  The pilot project on the South Side will remain in effect for the near future and Public Safety will continue to monitor its impact and effectiveness.   ","   29/9/2021 13:58:11   Public Safety to Reinstate Two-Way Traffic on East Carson Street  PITTSBURGH, PA, (September 30, 2021) – In the last week of July, Public Safety introduced a traffic pilot project in the busy South Side corridor in an effort to ease vehicle congestion, improve pedestrian safety, and mitigate an increase in violence in the area on weekend evenings. Thanks to the cooperation and patience of businesses and residents in the area, Public Safety is satisfied that these measures have resulted in several positive improvements.  As a result, beginning on Friday, October 1, 2021, traffic on East Carson Street will convert back to two-way traffic between S.10th and S.18th Streets in the evenings.   On Fridays and Saturdays, 'No Parking' measures will still be strictly enforced on these blocks of East Carson Street starting at 8 p.m., including the towing of vehicles, to keep this stretch of road clear for Public Safety vehicle access.  In addition to the traffic pattern shifts implemented in July, Pittsburgh Police increased the number of officers in the area and expanded enforcement. Over the past four weekends, Police working in the South Side corridor have made 12 arrests, one firearms-related arrest, one firearm seizure, issued 371 citations, and towed 69 vehicles. These enhanced enforcement measures will remain in place. “The Department of Public Safety is pleased with the progress that has been made to increase safety on the South Side. As promised, we engaged in regular discussions with residents and businesses during this time to share ideas on the impact and effectiveness of the pilot program and the stepped-up enforcement. We thank everyone for their patience and participation in this effort. It wasn't always easy to balance competing needs, but we are grateful for the partnerships that helped make this happen,"" said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. Public Safety will continue to monitor the South Side in the interest of keeping residents and visitors safe while they enjoy the many benefits this unique district has to offer. ","   PITTSBURGH, PA (July 28, 2021) – The Department of Public Safety, in coordination with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), is announcing adjustments to traffic patterns in the busy South Side business corridor on weekend evenings. As pandemic restrictions have eased, the increased volume of visitors to East Carson Street has created serious concerns such as increased gun violence, overcrowded sidewalks and streets, traffic safety obstacles, and noise complaints. In response, the City of Pittsburgh Public Safety is implementing the following changes as a pilot project: - Between the hours of 7 p.m. until 4 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, vehicle traffic will be allowed OUTBOUND ONLY on E. Carson Street between S.10th and S.18th Streets. - Side streets from S.11th to S.17th inclusive will be closed to traffic. Vehicles will be diverted around those streets via either Muriel Street or Sarah Street. Only valid residential permit holders will be allowed to enter these areas  - Only emergency vehicles and Port Authority buses will be allowed to travel in both directions on E. Carson - Ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft will not be permitted on East Carson Street between S.10th and S.18th Streets. Passengers must arrange pick-up and drop-off points in advance, utilizing one of the open side streets - Parking and deliveries will be prohibited on either side of E. Carson Street between 7 p.m. and 4 a.m. - Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers will be posted in key areas to ensure the safe flow of traffic - During this pilot period, PennDOT is working closely with the City of Pittsburgh to halt overnight work in connection with its East Carson Street Improvement Project These changes will be in place for the foreseeable future in an effort to mitigate gridlock, allow for a dedicated emergency vehicle corridor, and create a safer, more pleasant experience for residents and visitors to the South Side. “Public Safety recognizes that these traffic shifts will be an adjustment to those who live in or frequent the South Side. Our personnel will be working closely with businesses and community groups to ensure a seamless transition. We appreciate everyone’s cooperation and patience during this time,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich.","  PITTSBURGH, PA, (August 12, 2021) -- In recent weeks, the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety implemented a pilot project on the South Side to address mounting concerns regarding overcrowding, increased violence, and pedestrian safety on and around East Carson Street.  The primary intent of the plan has been to stem the flow of vehicle traffic into the commercial corridor to alleviate some of the density in the area during the busiest evening hours on the weekends.  While the strategy has been largely successful in helping to prevent violence and congestion on East Carson Street, Public Safety has remained in ongoing discussion with business owners who have asked for slight adjustments to ensure ease of access to restaurants and retail stores in the early evening hours.   With that in mind, Public Safety is making modifications to the times of day during which the measures will be implemented.  Beginning at 9:30 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, East Carson Street will convert from two-way to one-way traffic traveling eastbound (outbound) between S. 10th and S. 18th. The previous start time was 7:00 p.m.    On Fridays and Saturdays, 'No Parking' measures will be strictly enforced on these blocks of East Carson Street starting at 8 p.m., including the towing of vehicles, to keep this stretch clear for Public Safety vehicle access. Signage along East Carson will be clearly marked to reflect the altered parking hours for these days.  Side streets from S.11th to S.17th will remain open to through-traffic until 9:30 p.m., at which time vehicles will be diverted around those streets via either Muriel Street or Sarah Street. In previous weeks, the side streets were closed at 7:00 p.m.  ""The only way to ensure the South Side will remain safe and accessible to everyone will be to continue to engage in communication with residents and business owners, working together and truly listening to their needs, balanced with the overall goal of preventing violence. That dialogue will be open and ongoing, and we continue to thank everyone for their patience and cooperation,"" said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich.  The pilot project in the South Side will remain in effect for the near future and Public Safety will continue to monitor its impact and effectiveness.   12/8/2021 12:41:47   Public Safety Temporarily Pauses South Side Traffic Pilot During Building Demolition","  PITTSBURGH, PA (August 6, 2021) -- The Department of Public Safety is continuing the adjustments to traffic patterns in the busy South Side business corridor on weekend evenings.   The City of Pittsburgh Public Safety will strictly enforce no parking measures on Fridays and Saturdays, from 7 p.m. until 4 a.m. on East Carson Street. Businesses and residences may still be accessed using alternate routing.  As a reminder, the following guidelines are still in place:  -Beginning at 7pm on Fridays and Saturdays E. Carson Street will convert from two-way traffic to one-way traveling eastbound between S. 11th and S. 17th    -Only emergency vehicles and Port Authority buses will be allowed to travel in both directions on E. Carson.  -Ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft will not be permitted to stop on East Carson Street between S.10th and S.18th Streets.

Carson Street between 7 p.m. and 4 a.m.  - Side streets from S.11th to S.17th inclusive will be closed to traffic. Vehicles will be diverted around those streets via either Muriel Street or Sarah Street. Only residents will be allowed to enter these areas.  All feedback is welcomed to the City 3-1-1 Response Center (Dial 311 or 412-255-2621)   The 9-1-1 system should always be used for emergencies.  “We appreciate everyone’s patience during this second weekend of adjustments. Areas designated with No Parking signs will be heavily enforced. The Department of Public Safety recognizes the slight inconvenience, but the overall goal of increased safety, overcrowded sidewalks and street traffic needed to be addressed,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich."

","  13/12/2019 14:36:11   Public Safety Statement on First Night 2020  PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 26, 2019) – A Pittsburgh tradition will continue Tuesday, Dec. 31 when the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust hosts “First Night 2020” events at venues throughout Downtown. First Night events always attract large crowds to the Golden Triangle. As such, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich reminds everyone to have fun, but also to be safe and law-abiding. “By working with our partners at the Cultural Trust, the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership and regional law enforcement departments, Pittsburgh Public Safety will be there to assure a safe experience for all,” Hissrich said. “First Night is a special night in Pittsburgh. We’re going to keep it that way. Anyone interested in engaging in illegal activities is advised to just stay home.” Hissrich warned against an unsafe New Year’s Eve tradition in many large cities: Shooting guns into the air. What goes up must come down, and the results are tragic when people are hit by celebratory gunfire. Police will observe ShotSpotter activations throughout the city and officers will arrest anyone caught discharging a firearm in public. Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will work with partnering law enforcement agencies -- including the Pennsylvania State Police, State Park Rangers, Port Authority Police, the Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office and the Allegheny County Police -- to provide uniformed and plainclothes officers throughout First Night venues. The Mounted Unit and River Rescue also will be present. Police urge people to never drink and drive. Officers will be actively looking for impaired drivers. As a reminder, city law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of a structure.

As is the case every year, the celebration will bring large crowds throughout the Downtown area. Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich welcomes the holiday season revelers, and urges everyone to be safe, respectful and law-abiding. “First Night is a Pittsburgh tradition and Public Safety will be there to assure a safe experience for all,” Hissrich said. “We ask that people behave responsibly and safely. As with other large events Downtown and elsewhere in the city, there will be a significant police presence to maintain safety.” New Year’s Eve is traditionally a time when people celebrate with alcohol. Public Safety urges people not to drink and drive. Police will be actively looking for impaired drivers and arresting those who break the law. Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will work with partnering law enforcement agencies -- including the Pennsylvania State Police, State Park Rangers, Port Authority Police and the Allegheny County Police -- to provide uniformed and plainclothes officers throughout the venues. The Mounted Unit also will be on hand. Public Safety reminds the public that drones are not allowed, nor are illegal weapons. City law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of a structure. The weather forecast calls for mild temperatures, but rain during the day. Please dress appropriately. In addition, Public Safety reminds residents that celebratory gunfire remains a significant problem in many cities, particularly on New Year’s Eve. Sadly, the results are often tragic when innocent people are hit by the bullets. Any bullet discharged from a gun, even into the sky, must land somewhere, and when it does, there is significant risk of injury or death. Pittsburgh Public Safety is committed to a policy of zero tolerance of illegal gun use. Our mission is to protect the quality of life for all residents throughout our community by creating an environment of enhanced safety and security. Officers will respond to all ShotSpotter activations throughout the city and will arrest anyone caught discharging a firearm in public. As normal, officers will be deployed throughout the city to maintain the peace, prevent crime and violence, and arrest drunk drivers. Pittsburgh Public Safety utilizes the ShotSpotter gunfire alerts and analysis solution to detect and locate gunfire incidents and gather gunfire intelligence and data to fight crime and violence. ShotSpotter provides precision-policing solutions for law enforcement to help deter gun violence and make cities, campuses and facilities safer. ShotSpotter is used in more than 90 cities. ShotSpotter uses a wide-area network of acoustic sensors to detect when a gun is fired, and then precisely and quickly pinpoints the location of the gunfire. ShotSpotter is one of several cutting-edge technologies the City of Pittsburgh employs to ensure the safety and security of our residents and officers. “Sometimes you’ll get a call that there’s shots fired, but you don’t know where it’s at in that area,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “Now it’s more specific where it’s at, how many rounds are being fired and, tactically for the officer approaching the scene, it’s safer.” For more information on First Night celebrations, go to firstnightpgh.trustarts.org.

","   Gender Equity Commission To redress gender discrimination in the City, the Commission is selecting a method for conducting the Gender Analysis. The analysis will gather disaggregated data to address intersectional gender discrimination, including identity, expression, sexuality, race and ethnicity, diverse abilities, education, income, and other factors. Based upon the equity disparities identified in the gender analysis, the GEC will work with the City to create a specific five-year action plan and ongoing plans, then monitor and guide their implementation.","                                                                                                                                       Minutes                                                                                             LGBTQIA+ Commission                                                                                                                                       Apr 21, 2022                                                                                                                                       Minutes                                                                                             LGBTQIA+ Commission                                                                                                                                       Mar 17, 2022                                                                                                                                       Minutes                                                                                             LGBTQIA+ Commission                                                                                                                                       Jan 20, 2022                                                                                                                                       Minutes                                                                                                                   LGBTQIA+ Commission                                                                                                                                       Dec 16, 2021                                                                                                                                       Minutes                                                                                             LGBTQIA+ Commission                                                                                                                                       Nov 18, 2021                                                                                                                                       Minutes                                                                                             LGBTQIA+ Commission                                                                                                                                       Oct 21, 2021                                                                                                                                       Minutes                                                                                             LGBTQIA+ Commission                                                                                                                                       Sep 23, 2021                                                                                                                                       Minutes                                                                                             LGBTQIA+ Commission                                                                                                                                       Aug 26, 2021                                                                                                                                       Minutes                          Currently there are no archived videos in this section.

Everyone is dressed however they want to express themselves, kids are running around and everyone is there to have fun. The art itself is displayed on long walls of strand wood in a giant, spacious warehouse setting. Incredible photographs will share walls with kids' paintings and pop art, and it takes a minimum of an hour or so just to see this part.

What was the name of the team formed in 1943 when the Steelers merged with the Philadelphia Eagles?," The name of the team formed in 1943 when the Steelers merged with the Philadelphia Eagles was called the ""Steagles"".","  Philadelphia Eagles Main article: Eagles–Steelers rivalry The Philadelphia Eagles and Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967, they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35–13. The Steelers have lost ten straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 49–29–3.[126]","   History Further information: History of the Pittsburgh Steelers See also: American football in Western Pennsylvania Rooney family era (1933–present) The Steelers first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23–2 to the New York Giants.[6] Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 (1936).[12] Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White, a future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions.[6][13] Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers.[14] During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season, they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the ""Phil-Pitt Eagles"" and were known as the ""Steagles"". This team went 5–4–1.[15] In 1944, they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the ""Carpets"").[6] This team finished 0–10, marking the only winless team in franchise history.[16] The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947, tying for first place in the division at 8–4 with the Philadelphia Eagles. This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field, which the Steelers lost 21–0.[17] That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a ""Playoff Bowl"" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff.[18] In 1970, the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL–NFL merger, the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league.[19] The Steelers also received a $3 million ($24.3 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team.[20]","   1995 Bill Cowher Indianapolis Colts 20–16   2005 Invesco Field at Mile High (Denver) Denver Broncos 34–17   2008 Mike Tomlin Heinz Field (Pittsburgh) Baltimore Ravens 23–14   2010 New York Jets 24–19   Total AFC Championships won:  8  Division championships The Steelers were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1943 and were briefly in the Western Division in 1944, before returning to the Eastern Division until 1949. The team was then in the American Conference from 1950 to 1952, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966. They were then placed in the Century Division of the Eastern Conference in 1967. When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Steelers were placed in the AFC Central until 2001 when they were realigned into the AFC North Division.","   2017 13–3   2020 12–4   Total Division Championships won:  24  Logo and uniforms Further information: Logos and uniforms of the Pittsburgh Steelers A US Airways A319 featuring the colors and logo of the Pittsburgh Steelers. This Airbus A319 has since been repainted into American Airlines colors after the merger. The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the ""Steagles""; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used ""Vegas Gold"", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers ""gold"" is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the city's official flag. The Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the ""Steelmark"", originally designed by Pittsburgh's U.S. Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). In fact, it was Cleveland-based Republic Steel that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word ""Steelers"" surrounded by three astroids (hypocycloids of four cusps). The original meanings behind the astroids were, ""Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world."" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel.[100] While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word ""Steel"", the team was given permission to add ""ers"" in 1963 after a petition to AISI. The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently.[101] A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more. The Steelers, along with the New York Giants, are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The current uniform designs were introduced in 1968. The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In 1997, the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font (Futura Condensed) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey. The 2007–2011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in 2007. They were meant to evoke the memory of the 1963–1964 era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only. In 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their 1934 season. The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal striped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the ""bumblebee jerseys"" due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season.[102] Also in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black Color Rush uniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants. In 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from 1968 to 1997, coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed.[103] In 1979, the team owners were approached by then-Iowa Hawkeyes Head Coach Hayden Fry about designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers.[104] Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors.","  Football[edit] Further information: American football in Western Pennsylvania Pittsburgh Steelers' fans waving the Terrible Towel, a tradition that dates back to 1975 The city's professional team, NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, is named after the distribution company the Pittsburgh Steeling company established in 1927. News of the team has preempted news of elections and other events and are important to the region and its diaspora. The Steelers have been owned by the Rooney family since the team's founding in 1933, show consistency in coaching (only three coaches since the 1960s all with the same basic philosophy) and are noted as one of sports' most respectable franchises.[207] The Steelers have a long waiting list for season tickets, and have sold out every home game since 1972.[208] The team won four Super Bowls in a six-year span in the 1970s, a fifth Super Bowl in 2006, and a league record sixth Super Bowl in 2009. College football in the city dates to 1889[209] with the Division I (FBS) Panthers of the University of Pittsburgh posting nine national championships, qualifying 37 total bowl games, appearing in the 2018 ACC Championship Game, and winning the 2021 ACC Championship Game which was the program's first conference title since leaving the Big East for the ACC between the 2012 and 2013 seasons.[210] Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris have loyal fan bases that follow their lower (FCS) teams. Acrisure Stadium serves as home for the Steelers, Panthers, and both the suburban and city high school championships. Playoff franchises Pittsburgh Power and Pittsburgh Gladiators competed in the Arena Football League in the 1980s and 2010s respectively. The Gladiators hosted ArenaBowl I in the city, competing in two, but losing both before moving to Tampa, Florida and becoming the Storm.[211] The Pittsburgh Passion has been the city's professional women's football team since 2002 and plays its home games at Highmark Stadium. The Ed Debartolo owned Pittsburgh Maulers featured a Heisman Trophy winner in the mid-1980s, former superstar University of Nebraska running back Mike Rozier."
What is the name of the official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers?, The Steelers Digest,"  Newspaper The Steelers Digest is the only official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers.[221] It has been published for 22 years and is currently published by Dolphin/Curtis Publishing in Miami, Florida, which also handles several other publications. The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season. There are typically 24 issues of the paper within a publishing year. The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers.com page.  Usage in popular culture The Steelers' success over several decades has permeated film and literature. The Steelers are portrayed in the following big-budget Hollywood films:  The January 11, 1975, episode of the Mary Tyler Moore Show featured Super Bowl IX (featuring the Steelers) as a plot device.[222] Black Sunday in 1977[223] Heaven Can Wait in 1978[224] Smokey and the Bandit II in 1980[225] Fighting Back in 1980[226] Hey Kid, Catch! in 1980[227] ...All the Marbles in 1981 Evening Shade (TV series) 1990–1994[228] The Waterboy cameo by Bill Cowher in 1998[229] The Longest Yard in 2005 The Chief a theater production. Black and Yellow in 2010.[230] The Dark Knight Rises in 2012 features several Steelers players as the fictional Gotham Rogues, which was filmed in Heinz Field[231][232] Mad Men's April 14, 2013, episode has Don Draper, Pete Campbell and Roger Sterling meeting with two HJ Heinz executives. The executives are told that not only would the ad firm have given them tickets to the Steelers' November 19, 1967, game at the Giants, the firm would have worked it so that the Steelers would have won (they lost 20–28). Concussion in 2015 features players from the team suffering from CTE.[233] The protagonist of John Grisham's novel The Associate is a staunch Steelers fan.[234] In the summer of 2019, the Kennywood theme park located near Pittsburgh, opened a new land themed to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Steelers Country, featuring a major record-breaking coaster, the Steel Curtain.[235] The land, in addition to this ride, features a Steelers-themed experience, and an 'End Zone Restaurant'.","                  Pittsburgh Steelers | History, Schedule, Tickets & Bars | Visit Pittsburgh                                    Skip to content        Newsletter   Discover Your Persona                          59°F",    Pittsburgh Steelers - Wikipedia                                   Jump to content        Main menu      Main menu move to sidebar hide      Navigation     Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact us        Contribute     HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload fileSpecial pages                    Search            Search                       Appearance                 Donate  Create account  Log in         Personal tools      Donate Create account Log in        Pages for logged out editors learn more    ContributionsTalk                             Contents move to sidebar hide     (Top)      1 History     Toggle History subsection      1.1 Rooney family era (1933–present)       1.1.1 Chuck Noll years (1969–1991)         1.1.2 Bill Cowher years (1992–2006)         1.1.3 Mike Tomlin years (2007–present)           1.2 Summary         1.3 Ownership         1.4 Season-by-season records         1.5 Civil rights advocacy           2 Championships     Toggle Championships subsection      2.1 Super Bowl championships         2.2 AFC championships,"                  Steelers Nation, Here We Go | Celebrate the Steelers Year-round | Visit Pittsburgh                                    Skip to content        Newsletter   Discover Your Persona                          59°F                                        0 Saved           Navigation                         Things to DoFree Things to DoFamily FunTours & SightseeingOutdoor AdventureArts & CultureShoppingHealth & WellnessPittsburgh Sports TeamsCasinos & GamingFilm FestivalsEvents & FestivalsSubmit Your EventThis Week in PittsburghAnnual EventsHoliday EventsHalloween EventsFilm FestivalsFood FestivalsMarathons, Runs & WalksHotels & ResortsRestaurants & CulinaryBars & NightlifePittsburgh Craft BreweriesWineries & DistilleriesFarms & Farmers MarketsPlan Your TripPittsburgh Insiders GuideDiscounts and PassesBeyond PittsburghTransportationExplore Black Culture & HeritageLGBTQIA+ Travel in PittsburghPet-friendly TravelCollege VisitsSenior TravelMedical TravelAccessibility GuideWeatherWelcome CentersNewsletterNeighborhoodsMeetings and EventsMeet in PittsburghHotelsEvent ServicesMarketing ToolkitGroup TourSubmit RFPContact UsShow Your BadgeSportsPITTSBURGHAbout SportsPITTSBURGHSports Event PlannerSports FacilitiesCalendar of EventsSports Event AttendeePower of Sports Economy","  ^ ""Rooneys look to restructure Steelers ownership"".

After posting a 9–31 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers have gone 66–27–1 (including 42–6 in games played in Pittsburgh) since 1970 and currently lead the series 75–58–1;[108] The Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL in 1999 and won twelve straight meetings between 2003 and 2009. Additionally, the Browns posted losing streaks of 16 (1970–85) and 15 (2004–present) games in Pittsburgh. Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher coached the Browns special teams and secondary before following Marty Schottenheimer for a brief tenure as Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator and then hired by Pittsburgh. This has only intensified the rivalry.

What is the origin of Pittsburgh's shared black and gold color scheme among its professional sports teams?,"

            The origin of Pittsburgh's shared black and gold color scheme among its professional sports teams can be traced back to the late 19th century when the city was known for its industrial strength and economic prosperity.

            During this period, Pittsburgh had several professional sports teams that represented the city in various leagues. These teams included the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, the Pittsburgh Steelers football team, and the Pittsburgh Hornets basketball team.

            While each of these teams had their unique identities and traditions, they all shared a common bond in representing the city of Pittsburgh on the national stage.

            To further strengthen this connection and create a sense of unity among the city's professional sports teams, it was decided that they would all adopt a shared color scheme based on the colors of the city flag - black and gold.

            This decision was made official in 1948 when the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team replaced their traditional blue and red uniforms with the new black and gold color scheme.

            The success of this change in the Pirates' uniform design not only helped to solidify the shared black and gold color scheme among Pittsburgh's professional sports teams but also inspired other cities with multiple professional sports teams to adopt similar color schemes based on their city flags.

            Today, the shared black and gold color scheme among Pittsburgh's professional sports teams - the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, the Pittsburgh Steelers football team, and the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team - continues to be a source of pride and unity for the city and its residents.","   2017 13–3   2020 12–4   Total Division Championships won:  24  Logo and uniforms Further information: Logos and uniforms of the Pittsburgh Steelers A US Airways A319 featuring the colors and logo of the Pittsburgh Steelers. This Airbus A319 has since been repainted into American Airlines colors after the merger. The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the ""Steagles""; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used ""Vegas Gold"", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers ""gold"" is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the city's official flag. The Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the ""Steelmark"", originally designed by Pittsburgh's U.S. Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). In fact, it was Cleveland-based Republic Steel that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word ""Steelers"" surrounded by three astroids (hypocycloids of four cusps). The original meanings behind the astroids were, ""Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world."" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel.[100] While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word ""Steel"", the team was given permission to add ""ers"" in 1963 after a petition to AISI. The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently.[101] A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more. The Steelers, along with the New York Giants, are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The current uniform designs were introduced in 1968. The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In 1997, the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font (Futura Condensed) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey. The 2007–2011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in 2007. They were meant to evoke the memory of the 1963–1964 era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only. In 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their 1934 season. The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal striped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the ""bumblebee jerseys"" due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season.[102] Also in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black Color Rush uniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants. In 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from 1968 to 1997, coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed.[103] In 1979, the team owners were approached by then-Iowa Hawkeyes Head Coach Hayden Fry about designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers.[104] Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors.","  Sports[edit] Main article: Sports in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh hosted the first professional football game and the first World Series. In 2009, Pittsburgh won the Sporting News title of ""Best Sports City"" in the United States[198] and, in 2013, Sperling's Best Places ""top 15 cities for baseball"".[199] College sports also have large followings with the University of Pittsburgh in football and sharing Division I basketball fans with Robert Morris and Duquesne. Pittsburgh has a long history with its major professional sports teams—the Steelers of the National Football League, the Penguins of the National Hockey League, and the Pirates of Major League Baseball—which all share the same team colors, the official city colors of black and gold.[f] Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States where this practice of sharing team colors in solidarity takes place.[200] The black-and-gold color scheme has since become widely associated with the city and personified in its famous Terrible Towel.[201] Further, the Pittsburgh Riverhounds professional soccer team of the USL Championship division wear black and gold colors. ""Rails to Trails"", has converted miles of former rail tracks to recreational trails, including a Pittsburgh-Washington D.C. bike/walking trail.[202] Several mountain biking trails are within the city and suburbs, Frick Park has biking trails and Hartwood Acres Park has many miles of single track trails.[203][204]","  Figures with broadcasting resumés[edit]  Nellie Briles Steve Blass Joe Garagiola Ralph Kiner Bob Walk John Wehner  See also[edit]  Baseball portalPittsburgh portalPennsylvania portal List of Pittsburgh Pirates seasons Green Weenie References[edit]   ^ ""Pirates Uniforms and Logos"".

Be it on the ice at PPG Paints Arena, on the gridiron at Heinz Field or within the picture-perfect confines of PNC Park, Pittsburgh is bathed in black and gold. And because even the most garish styles tend to go and come around again, the bumblebee yellow jerseys, striped black pants and pillbox-style hats of the 1970s made a recent return as the go-to Sunday throwbacks.",What is Black Pittsburgh Matters focused on?,"  Team information Crest and sweater design When the Penguins made their NHL debut in 1967, the team wore the colors dark blue, light blue and white. The uniforms had the word ""Pittsburgh"" written diagonally down the front of the sweater with three dark blue stripes around the sleeves and bottom. The logo featured a hockey-playing penguin in a scarf over an inverted triangle, symbolizing the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh. A refined version of the logo appeared on a redesigned uniform in the second season, which removed the scarf and gave the penguin a sleeker look. The circle encompassing the logo was later removed.[73] The team's colors were originally powder blue, navy blue, and white. The powder blue was changed to royal blue in 1973 but returned in 1977. The team adopted the current black and gold color scheme in 1980 to unify the colors of the city's professional sports teams although, like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Steelers, the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow. The change was not without controversy, as the Boston Bruins protested by claiming to own the rights to the black and gold colors. However, the Penguins cited the colors worn by the now-defunct NHL team the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1920s, as well as black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and its namesake, and obtained permission to use the black and gold colors. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates used old Pittsburgh Police uniforms,[74] beginning the black and gold color tradition in the city.[73] The Penguins generally wore the black and gold ""skating penguin"" uniform between 1980 and 1992, with a few noticeable changes in the lettering and striping. A gold alternate uniform was worn between 1980 and 1984, and briefly replaced the white uniform for home games in the 1983–84 season.[73] In the 1992–93 season, the Penguins unveiled new uniforms and introduced the ""flying penguin"" logo, or ""Robopenguin"".[75][76] The team's away uniforms were a throwback to the team's first season, as they revived the diagonal ""Pittsburgh"" script. In 1995, the team introduced their second alternate jersey, featuring different stripe designs on each sleeve. This jersey proved to be so popular that the team adopted it as their away jersey in 1997. In 2000, the Penguins brought back the ""skating penguin"" logo, but with a ""Vegas gold"" shade, upon releasing its new alternate uniform. After 2002, the ""skating penguin"" was readopted as the primary, though the ""flying penguin"" remained the alternate. A corresponding white version of the ""Vegas gold"" uniforms was introduced, and the 1995–2002 black uniform was retired. When the new jerseys were unveiled for the 2007–08 season league wide, the Penguins made major striping pattern changes and removed the ""flying penguin"" logo from the shoulders.[73]"
What significant milestone did the Pittsburgh Steelers achieve in 1984 regarding diversity within their coaching staff?,"

            The Pittsburgh Steelers made history in 1984 by becoming the first professional sports team to hire a minority coach as part of their full-time coaching staff. 

            On September 2, 1984, the Steelers announced that they had hired Tony Dungy as their new defensive backs coach. Dungy was the first African American coach to be hired by the Steelers in their storied history. 

            The hiring of Dungy marked a significant milestone for the Pittsburgh Steelers and for professional sports in general. It demonstrated the team's commitment to diversity and inclusion, and it set an example for other teams and organizations to follow. 

            Over the years, Tony Dungy went on to have a distinguished coaching career. He became the first African American head coach in the NFL when he was hired by the Indianapolis Colts in 2002. Under his leadership, the Colts won Super Bowl XLI in 2007. 

            Dungy retired from coaching after the 2016 season, but his legacy as a trailblazer and role model for diversity and inclusion in sports continues to inspire and influence future generations of athletes, coaches, and fans.",    Pittsburgh Steelers - Wikipedia                                   Jump to content        Main menu      Main menu move to sidebar hide      Navigation     Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact us        Contribute     HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload fileSpecial pages                    Search            Search                       Appearance                 Donate  Create account  Log in         Personal tools      Donate Create account Log in        Pages for logged out editors learn more    ContributionsTalk                             Contents move to sidebar hide     (Top)      1 History     Toggle History subsection      1.1 Rooney family era (1933–present)       1.1.1 Chuck Noll years (1969–1991)         1.1.2 Bill Cowher years (1992–2006)         1.1.3 Mike Tomlin years (2007–present)           1.2 Summary         1.3 Ownership         1.4 Season-by-season records         1.5 Civil rights advocacy           2 Championships     Toggle Championships subsection      2.1 Super Bowl championships         2.2 AFC championships,"           Steelers Hall of Fame Inductees 2021 Scout, Bill Nunn2021 Guard, Alan Faneca2020 Safety, Troy Polamalu2020 Safety, Donnie Shell2020 Head Coach, Bill Cowher2016 Linebacker, Kevin Greene2015 Running Back, Jerome Bettis2012 Center, Dermontti Dawson2012 Cornerback, Jack Butler2009 Cornerback, Rod Woodson2002 Wide Receiver, John Stallworth2001 Wide Receiver, Lynn Swann2000 President, Chairman Daniel M.

He did not use the term ""retire"", leaving open a possible return to the NFL as coach of another team.[37] A three-man committee consisting of Art Rooney II, Dan Rooney, and Kevin Colbert was set up to conduct interviews for the head coaching vacancy.[38] On January 22, 2007, Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin was announced as Cowher's successor as head coach.[39] Tomlin is the first African-American to be named head coach of the team in its 75-year history.[40] In his first season, he led the Steelers to a 10–6 record and AFC North title.[41] The team fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars 31–29 in the Wild Card Round to end the season.[42] The following year, he led the Steelers to a 12–4 mark and a division title.[43] With wins over the San Diego Chargers in the Divisional Round and the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship,[44][45] Tomlin became the third consecutive Steelers Head Coach to go to the Super Bowl, equaling the Dallas Cowboys (Tom Landry, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer) in this achievement. On February 1, 2009, Tomlin led the Steelers to their second Super Bowl of this decade, and went on to win 27–23 against the Arizona Cardinals.[46] At age 36, he was the youngest head coach to ever win the Super Bowl, and he is only the second African-American coach to ever win the Super Bowl (Tony Dungy was the first).[47] In their title defense, the Steelers went 9–7 and missed the postseason in the 2009 season.[48] In the 2010 season, Tomlin led the team to a 12–4 record and an AFC North title.[49] The team defeated the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round and the New York Jets in the AFC Championship.[50][51] Tomlin became the only coach to reach the Super Bowl twice before the age of 40 as he took the team to Super Bowl XLV on February 6, 2011.

They lost in overtime to the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round.[53] The Steelers recorded their 400th victory in Week 8 of the 2012 season after defeating the Washington Redskins.[54] Overall, the Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason in 2012.[55] In the 2013 season, the Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason.[56] In the 2014 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11–5 record.[57] They lost 30–17 to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.[58] The Steelers finished with a 10–6 record and made the playoffs in the 2015 season.[59] They defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the Wild Card Round and lost to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.[60][61] In the 2016 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11–5 record.[62] They defeated the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card Round and the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round before falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship.[63][64][65] In the 2017 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 13–3 mark.[66] Their postseason was short lived with a 45–42 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.[67] Despite a 9–6–1 record in the 2018 season, the Steelers missed the playoffs.[68] The Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason in the 2019 season.[69] The 2020 season saw the Steelers have franchise-best 11–0 start.[70] However, the team faded at the end of the season to finish 12–4.[71] The team lost in the Wild Card Round to the Cleveland Browns 48–37.[72] The 2021 season saw the team go 9–7–1 and make the postseason.[73] The Steelers lost 42–21 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card Round.[74] Longtime quarterback Ben Roethlisberger retired following the 2021 season.[75] Through the end of the 2021 season, Tomlin's record is 162–94–2 (.632), including playoffs. He is the first Pittsburgh coach to never post a losing season. The 2013–17 seasons were noted for record performances from the ""Killer B's"". This trio consisted of Antonio Brown, Ben Roethlisberger and Le'Veon Bell.[76] Occasionally, the ""Killer B's"" has also included kicker Chris Boswell due to his ability to hit game-winning field goals.[77] Prior to the 2022 season, the team drafted Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett with their first round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft.[78] Pickett started 12 games as the Steelers went 9–8 and missed the postseason in the 2022 season.[79] In the 2023 season, the team finished 10–7 and third in the AFC North.[80] They made the playoffs and were defeated by the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round 31–17.[81] Prior to the 2024 season, the Steelers traded Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles.[82] The team traded for Justin Fields from the Chicago Bears and signed Russell Wilson, who was released from the Denver Broncos.[83][84]"

He was very involved in delivering relief packages to to the people of Managua, Nicaragua after they were affected by a earthquake. Clemente learned that some of the aid packages weren't making it to the victims so he accompanied the team to Nicaragua on the 4th relief flight on New Years Eve. The plane crashed due to mechanical errors, and Roberto Clemente and the four others on the plane died. The baseball world was forever changed. Clemente is honored all throughout Pittsburgh. A bridge is named after him, PNC Park has a statue dedicated to him, and there is a Roberto Clemente Museum. The Pirates and Major League Baseball do so much to honor this national hero. They have an award named after him ""The Clemente Award"" that is presented to the player who ""best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, and community involvement"". Roberto Clemente not only shaped the game of baseball, he shaped Pittsburgh and Puerto Rico. He supported his Latino community and Pittsburgh community with full efforts.","   Bold  Recipient of the Hall of Fame's Ford C.

Fan support was so low by the team's first bankruptcy that the NHL had no problem with the team being moved, something that would change decades later when the team faced another relocation threat. While the drafting of Mario Lemieux piqued interest in hockey locally, fans remained skeptical. John Steigerwald, brother of former Penguins broadcaster Paul Steigerwald,[98] noted in his autobiography that upon his arrival at KDKA-TV from WTAE-TV in 1985, the station cared more about the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League than the Penguins.[99] However, Lemieux's play steadily grew the fanbase in the area, which would only be reassured upon the arrival of Sidney Crosby after the team struggled both on the ice and in attendance following the Jaromir Jagr trade. Today, the Penguins are one of the NHL's most popular teams, especially among American non-Original Six franchises, and are considered second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams, taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates struggles both on and off the field.[100] Especially notable was a 2007 survey done of the four major sports leagues' 122 teams. The Penguins surprised observers by being ranked 20th overall and third among NHL teams, while the Steelers were ranked number one and the Pirates (before the arrival of Andrew McCutchen and that team's turnaround)[101] ranked much lower on the list than its peers. The Penguins' popularity has at times rivaled that of the Steelers at the local level.[102]","  Fanbase[edit] Bing Crosby co-owned the Pirates from 1946 until his death in 1977. Even though they have had some notable fans including former part-owner Bing Crosby, Michael Keaton, and Regis Philbin,[107] the Pirates are considered by most to be a distant third in Pittsburgh behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Penguins in popularity among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams.[108] However, due to their long history in Pittsburgh dating back to the 1882 season, the team has retained a strong loyal following in the Pittsburgh region, especially among older residents. Upon the team ending their 20-season losing season streak with a winning season in 2013, the fan support for the club has grown once again but still remaining a distant third behind the city's other 2 more successful franchises in the last half-century. While the team's recent struggles compared to Pittsburgh's other two teams can be partly to blame (since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979, the Steelers have won the Super Bowl 3 times (XIV, XL, and XLIII) and the Penguins the Stanley Cup five times in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017, including both in 2009), distractions off the field have also caused the team's popularity to slip in the city. While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s,[109] the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985 and two relocation threats since are believed to have also seen the team's popularity dipped.[110] The team's standing among fans has, however, improved along with the team on the field and the opening of PNC Park in 2001.[111] Following the Andrew McCutchen trade in 2018, fan relations have deteriorated despite the Pirates contending for the NL Central during 2018 due to backlash towards owner Robert Nutting, with the team ranking 27th among 30 MLB team in attendance that season.[112] When the Penguins won the Stanley Cup in 2009 captain Sidney Crosby brought the cup to PNC Park on the Sunday following the team's victory in Detroit. When they won again in 2017 the cup was once again brought to PNC Park and the team threw out the first pitch. The team won the cup in 1992 and they held a celebration in the Pirates' old home Three Rivers Stadium.","  ^ Stark, Logan (May 3, 2018).

What is one way fans can explore the history of the Pittsburgh Steelers?,"
            One way fans can explore the history of the Pittsburgh Steelers is by visiting the team's Hall of Honor Museum at Acrisure Stadium. The museum offers interactive exhibits, artifacts, and multimedia presentations that tell the story of the Steelers from their inception to the present day. Fans can also learn about the team's rich tradition of championships, civil rights advocacy, and community involvement. Overall, a visit to the Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is an essential experience for any fan of the Steelers or football history in general.","             A Complete Steelers History  When you have a team this storied and with so many accolades, I think it would've been easy for the Steelers to focus on the 70s and 2000s eras only. What I absolutely loved about the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum, however, is that is paints a complete picture of the Steelers franchise that lets guests truly understand the team. The very first panel you'll see in the museum harkens back to football history, noting that the first professional football game was played in Latrobe (hey, that's my hometown!), just a short drive from Pittsburgh. You'll see the struggles of the early teams, the impact of World War II on the rosters and the difficulties Art Rooney had to overcome. In the end, experiencing so much history about non-championship seasons made me appreciate those Ws even more. The Hall of Honor Museum is a celebration of all things Steelers, not just the Lombardi trophies, and show the tireless efforts of the Rooneys, coaches and players who led this team to the Super Bowl again and again.",    Pittsburgh Steelers - Wikipedia                                   Jump to content        Main menu      Main menu move to sidebar hide      Navigation     Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact us        Contribute     HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload fileSpecial pages                    Search            Search                       Appearance                 Donate  Create account  Log in         Personal tools      Donate Create account Log in        Pages for logged out editors learn more    ContributionsTalk                             Contents move to sidebar hide     (Top)      1 History     Toggle History subsection      1.1 Rooney family era (1933–present)       1.1.1 Chuck Noll years (1969–1991)         1.1.2 Bill Cowher years (1992–2006)         1.1.3 Mike Tomlin years (2007–present)           1.2 Summary         1.3 Ownership         1.4 Season-by-season records         1.5 Civil rights advocacy           2 Championships     Toggle Championships subsection      2.1 Super Bowl championships         2.2 AFC championships,"                The Steelers recently opened their own Hall of Honor to recognize all the great contributors to this historic franchise.

In August 2008, ESPN.com ranked the Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their ""unbelievable"" sellout streak of 299 consecutive games.[11][129] The team gained a large fan base nationally based on its success in the 1970s, but many consider the collapse of the city's steel industry at the end of the 1970s dynasty into the 1980s (and the resulting diaspora) to be a large catalyst for the size of the fan base in other cities.[130] The Steelers have sold out every home game since the 1972 season.[131] The Pittsburgh Steelers have numerous unofficial fan clubs in many cities throughout the country, that typically meet in bars or taverns on game days. This phenomenon is known to occur for other NFL teams as well, but ""Steeler bars"" are more visible than most, including representative establishments even in cities that field their own NFL teams."

What is unique about Manny's BBQ Left Field at PNC Park?,"

            Manny's BBQ Left Field at PNC Park is unique because it is named after former Pirates catcher Manny Sanguillen. The newly remodeled barbecue stand offers a variety of house smoked BBQ pork and chicken, mac n cheese, topped mini pierogis, slaw, and Primanti's sandwiches. The stand also features a new addition of the topped Mrs. T's mini pierogis you can get with either BBQ pork or chicken. Manny himself is often seen hanging around the stand, happy to chat with fans and relive some of his greatest moments.","                      PNC PARK FAVORITES          Manny's BBQ Left FieldThis newly remodeled barbecue stand is named after former Pirates catcher Manny Sanguillen, who has been known to hang around and sign autographs for fans. Eagle-eyed snack connoisseurs will note the new addition of the topped Mrs. T's mini pierogis you can get with either BBQ pork or chickenOn the menu: house smoked BBQ pork and chicken, mac n cheese, topped mini pierogis, slaw","         Primanti's and Manny's locations          Don't Forget the Classics We were stuffed after our culinary tour, but it’s still worth mentioning a few other spots for great grub in the park. Grab some Only In Pittsburgh Primanti Bros. sandwiches, piled high with coleslaw and french fries, located behind section 108. My personal PNC Park tradition is to always make sure I stop by Manny’s (also sporting a newly-designed space) in left field, where you can often find Pirates great Manny Sanguillén seated near the end of the line, who is happy to chat with fans and relive some of his greatest moments.","  PNC Park prior to a game in 2014 Widely considered to be among the best baseball stadiums in the country, several outlets have praised PNC Park for its location, limestone and steel façade, and views of both the action on the field and the Pittsburgh skyline.[22][23][24][25] PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953;[26] as a result, fans in the upper deck are closer to the action than at most ballparks, with the highest seat in the stadium 88 feet (27 m) above the playing surface. Fans in the lower deck are also closer to the field: the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher,[27] and seating along the baselines is 45 feet  from the bases at their closest point. A four-level steel rotunda down the left field line offers extensive standing room only space, and action on the field can be seen from the first-level concourse. PNC Park has a reputation as a pitcher's park, with a deep left field that juts out to more than 410 feet from home plate. Right field is closer, but the wall is 21 feet high, nicknamed the Clemente Wall after former right-fielder Roberto Clemente, who wore number 21. Statutes of Clemente, Willie Stargell, Bill Mazeroski and Honus Wagner are located at several entrances to the stadium. In addition to hosting Pirate games, PNC Park hosted the 2006 MLB All-Star Game and has been the site of several concerts. PNC Park is located near several major highways and parking is available in the blocks around the ballpark. Fans can also walk to the stadium from downtown Pittsburgh via the Clemente Bridge, or take Pittsburgh Light Rail to the system's North Side station, located just outside the stadium's home plate entrance.","      Visit Iconic Stadiums and Pittsburgh Icons             The North Shore is best known as the location of Acrisure Stadium and PNC Park. These stadiums are the homes of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Pirates, respectively. I go to PNC Park at least once every summer. It’s the most beautiful ballpark in baseball. The view of Downtown from behind home plate is breathtaking. If the weather is just right, a rainbow may arc over the skyline, beyond the outfield. If the Pirates are out of town during your visit, book a tour of the park – you’re sure to go home with a memorable photo! Though the food offerings in the stadiums are beyond standard fare, consider also grabbing a meal, snack or brew at one of the nearby restaurants or breweries.

Somehow that just seems so right. Those who knew and loved Myron, friends and fans alike, know he’s somewhere smiling and cheering, ""Here We Go Steelers, Here We Go!""

In Pittsburgh for the big game? We've got the scoop on how to enjoy the ultimate sports city!","             Jump, Cheer and Yell with Interactive Exhibits  With three energetic kids, a stuffy, quiet museum is not an option. Luckily, the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is family-friendly and perfect for even the most boisterous fans on game day. Interactive displays let guests select the era they're interested in, scroll timelines of important events and re-live impactful moments like one section dedicated entirely to the Immaculate Reception. Think you can outdo Myron Cope? Enter the broadcast booth and pick a classic play which you can then do commentary on! At the end, the display plays back video and audio of how you did, which is sure to bring lots of laughs. Near the end of the Museum, interactive displays let you measure up to the Steelers, encouraging you to run out of the entrance tunnel and jump as high as you can just like you're taking the field at Acrisure to a raucous crowd.             Honoring Steelers Legends  After you're done viewing all six Super Bowl rings, the final part of the exhibit is perhaps the true highlight. A massive wall of bronzed footballs enshrines each member of the Hall of Honor, with multiple displays that let you select a person, scroll through a timeline of their life and play videos of some of their most memorable moments. Diehard Steelers fans, you can easily spend an hour or two just in this room. With new members added yearly (and hopefully a new Super Bowl ring to add soon), there's a new reason to tour the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum each season.","             A Complete Steelers History  When you have a team this storied and with so many accolades, I think it would've been easy for the Steelers to focus on the 70s and 2000s eras only. What I absolutely loved about the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum, however, is that is paints a complete picture of the Steelers franchise that lets guests truly understand the team. The very first panel you'll see in the museum harkens back to football history, noting that the first professional football game was played in Latrobe (hey, that's my hometown!), just a short drive from Pittsburgh. You'll see the struggles of the early teams, the impact of World War II on the rosters and the difficulties Art Rooney had to overcome. In the end, experiencing so much history about non-championship seasons made me appreciate those Ws even more. The Hall of Honor Museum is a celebration of all things Steelers, not just the Lombardi trophies, and show the tireless efforts of the Rooneys, coaches and players who led this team to the Super Bowl again and again.","                        < Back           Insider's Guide to the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum Relive 90 years of Steelers history with interactive exhibits for all fans of the black and gold Just opened at the end of 2022, the brand new Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is a spectacle, encapsulating 90 years of Steelers history and nearly 50 Hall of Honor inductees across 10,000 square feet of Acrisure Stadium. My first impression was shock at just how massive the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is. Guests enter via the B Suite gates right next to the Pro Shop, and the stage is set by a stadium seating hype video before turning guests loose into the museum proper. Long corridors twist and turn through rare artifacts, many on display for the first time, as well as retellings and recreations of the biggest moments of the team."

What was the final score when the Steelers won their unprecedented sixth Super Bowl Championship?," The final score when the Steelers won their unprecedented sixth Super Bowl Championship was Steelers 27, Arizona Cardinals 23.","  Steelers' five Super Bowl rings before 2009 Cowher led the Steelers to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons, a feat that had been accomplished only by legendary coach Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns. In those first six seasons, Cowher coached them as deep as the AFC Championship Game three times and following the 1995 season an appearance in Super Bowl XXX on the strength of the ""Blitzburgh"" defense. However, the Steelers lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX, two weeks after a thrilling AFC Championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts.[33][34] Cowher produced the franchise's record-tying fifth Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XL over the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks ten years later.[35] With that victory, the Steelers became the third team to win five Super Bowls, and the first sixth-seeded playoff team to reach and win the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team post-season tournament in 1990. He coached through the 2006 season which ended with an 8–8 record, just short of the playoffs. Overall Cowher's teams reached the playoffs 10 of 15 seasons with six AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl berths and a championship. Cowher's career record with Pittsburgh was 149–90–1 in the regular season and 161–99–1 overall, including playoff games.[36]","  The Steelers went on to host another home game the following week, Jan. 23, 2005, vs. the Patriots.

            The 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates are the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit.","   Bibliography[edit] Markusen, Bruce.

The Alleghenies won the game 7–3.[12] The 1877 squad was the most successful yet, finishing within 1 game of the pennant in the International Association; only a Canadian team had a better record, allowing the city potential bragging rights for being the best American team that season. 1882 marked the first ""major league"" and fully professional season for the Pittsburgh Alleghenies (Pirates) and in 1887, the Alleghenies moved from American Association to the National League after owner William Nimick became frustrated over a contract dispute.[13] The Pirates were purchased in 1900 by Barney Dreyfuss, who would go down in history as the ""Father of the modern World Series"" and its precursor, the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup, both of which saw the Pirates participate in the inaugural series. He recruited Hall of Famers Fred Clarke and Pittsburgh native Honus Wagner and built the first concrete and steel (first ""modern"") baseball stadium, Forbes Field. Under Dreyfuss, the Pirates won pre-World Series world titles in 1901 and 1902, National League pennants from 1901–1903, 1909, 1925 and 1927 and World Series in 1909 and 1925.  The 1902 squad set major league records for winning percentage and even today is the second most winning team ever fielded in the sport.[14] The franchise won the World Series three more times— in 1960, 1971, and 1979.  In 1960, the team became the first to win a World Series on a walk-off home run, hit by Bill Mazeroski, and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game.  In 1979, the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team, coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit, winning three games in a row when facing elimination, for the title.  Thus the Pirates became (and they currently remain) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit.  The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards:  Seasonal (Willie Stargell, co-MVP with Keith Hernandez), All Star Game (Dave Parker), NLCS (Willie Stargell), and World Series (Willie Stargell) within a single season.[15]  Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times:  six in the 1970s, and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992.  Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 (Dick Groat), 1966 (Roberto Clemente), 1978 (Dave Parker), 1979 (Willie Stargell), 1990 (Barry Bonds), 1992 (Barry Bonds), and 2013 (Andrew McCutchen) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 (Vernon Law) and 1990 (Doug Drabek).  In 2001, the team opened PNC Park on the city's North Shore, regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country. In addition to the Pirates, the Pittsburgh Stogies, Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915.  The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915.[16] The Pittsburgh Keystones, Homestead Grays (playing in the city limits), and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues. With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles—the most by any Negro league team[1]—including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945. The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633 winning percentage, with a line-up including Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936, with the 1935 team judged by some[who?] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues, or perhaps in baseball period.  Just as they initially played in the first ""modern"" ballpark in the majors (Forbes Field), Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete ""modern"" stadium in the Negro leagues, with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29, 1932.[17]","   ^ Includes conference championships and post-1900 MLB league pennants.

What arrangements were made to ensure independent investigations of officer-involved shootings and in-custody deaths?,"

            In response to concerns regarding officer-involved shootings and in-custody deaths, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) has established an Office of Professional Standards (OPS). 

            The OPS is responsible for conducting independent investigations into all allegations of misconduct by PBP personnel. This includes, but is not limited to, officer-involved shootings and in-custody deaths. 

            The OPS is staffed with experienced investigators who are trained in the latest investigative techniques. They work independently from the chain of command to ensure impartiality and objectivity in their investigations. 

            The findings and recommendations of the OPS investigations are presented to the Command Staff for review and action. Disciplinary action will be issued as warranted and handled internally. 

            It is important to note that while the OPS conducts independent investigations, they do not have the authority to prosecute individuals or make determinations of guilt or innocence. That responsibility lies with the Allegheny County District Attorney's Office.","  PITTSBURGH, PA ( November 3, 2022) -- Following the tragic shooting incident that occurred outside the Destiny of Faith Church on October 28, 2022, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police began conducting inquiries into whether police protection was provided during a funeral at the church. Command Staff interviewed personnel on duty that day and learned a police presence had been requested for the service, but the request was not fulfilled.  “We regret that PBP did not provide the presence asked of us on a difficult day. As a matter of policy, we are conducting an internal investigation into what went wrong in this situation. As not only police officers, but members of this community, we consider this totally unacceptable. As previously stated in other briefings, it is our hope that the inactions of a few do not reflect negatively on the actions of many who worked diligently to respond, investigate and bring those responsible to justice in the aftermath of this tragedy, ” said Acting Chief of Police Thomas Stangrecki. Disciplinary action will be issued as warranted and handled internally.  As this is a personnel matter, there will no be further information provided at this time.","  21/9/2017 06:33:22   NON-FATAL SHOOTING UNDER INVESTIGATION  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  PITTSBURGH, PA – The Group Violence Intervention Unit is investigating the non-fatal shooting of two females who arrived at AGH by private means.
