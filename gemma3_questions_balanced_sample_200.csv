https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Safety/Animal-Care-Control/Animal-Control-FAQs,"  Be proactive! Nobody expects a pet to go missing, so your pet should always wear a collar with an ID tag that has your phone number on it. Check the tag regularly to ensure it is still readable. Have your pet spayed or neutered. In addition to all the health benefits, it decreases an animal's desire to roam away from home. Pittsburgh residents are eligible for the City's free spay/neuter program for up to 5 pets! Check out the Spay/Neuter Program tab for an application and details. Get your pet microchipped this permanent form of ID can't be detached or obscured. Local shelters offer microchips at reduced rates. Make sure to keep your information updated with the microchip company if you move or get a new phone number Take photos of your pet (as if we had to ask you to do that!). Be sure to keep a few current ones on hand for emergency purposes If your pet has gotten away from you, call the local shelters. The open door shelter in Pittsburgh is Humane Animal Rescue at 412-345-7300. You need to file a lost report with them in case someone finds your pet. However, because descriptions may vary (you might call your dog tan while a shelter worker calls him yellow), it is best to visit the shelters in person. Making a flyer complete with color photos of your pet will help! You can bring a copy of the flyer to local shelters, post flyers around your neighborhood, and post the information to social media sites. Any animal picked up by Pittsburgh Animal Care and Control is taken to the Animal Rescue League, so if you've filed your lost report with them, you are covered if your pet is picked up by our officers",What phone number should be included on a pet's identification tag?,A pet's identification tag should always include your phone number to allow for easy contact if the pet goes missing.,Specific information questions,General Info and History of Pittsburgh/CMU,Your phone number.

penguins_wiki_text.csv,"  Fanbase Iceburgh, the mascot of the Pittsburgh Penguins Despite Pittsburgh's long history with hockey and a small but loyal fanbase, the Penguins struggled with fan support early on in its history, at times averaging only 6,000 fans per game when Civic Arena had a seating capacity of over 16,000. Fan support was so low by the team's first bankruptcy that the NHL had no problem with the team being moved, something that would change decades later when the team faced another relocation threat. While the drafting of Mario Lemieux piqued interest in hockey locally, fans remained skeptical. John Steigerwald, brother of former Penguins broadcaster Paul Steigerwald,[98] noted in his autobiography that upon his arrival at KDKA-TV from WTAE-TV in 1985, the station cared more about the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League than the Penguins.[99] However, Lemieux's play steadily grew the fanbase in the area, which would only be reassured upon the arrival of Sidney Crosby after the team struggled both on the ice and in attendance following the Jaromir Jagr trade. Today, the Penguins are one of the NHL's most popular teams, especially among American non-Original Six franchises, and are considered second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams, taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates struggles both on and off the field.[100] Especially notable was a 2007 survey done of the four major sports leagues' 122 teams. The Penguins surprised observers by being ranked 20th overall and third among NHL teams, while the Steelers were ranked number one and the Pirates (before the arrival of Andrew McCutchen and that team's turnaround)[101] ranked much lower on the list than its peers. The Penguins' popularity has at times rivaled that of the Steelers at the local level.[102]",What factors contributed to the Pittsburgh Penguins' growth in popularity?,"Despite initial struggles with low fan support and even a relocation threat, the Penguins' fanbase grew due to the arrival and play of Mario Lemiuex and Sidney Crosby, capitalizing on the Pittsburgh Pirates' struggles.",Specific information questions,General Info and History of Pittsburgh/CMU,"Mario Lemieux and Sidney Crosby's arrival, combined with the Pirates' decline, fueled the Penguins' popularity."
penguins_wiki_text.csv,"  The UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex under construction in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania, in April 2015. The complex opened in August 2015, and is used by the Penguins as their practice facility. From 1995 to 2015, the IceoPlex at Southpointe in the South Hills suburbs served as the team's practice facility. Robert Morris University's 84 Lumber Arena has served as a secondary practice facility for the team. During the franchise's first pre-season training camp and pre-season exhibition games, the Brantford Civic Centre in Brantford, Ontario, served as its home,[92] and by the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, the team was using the suburban Rostraver Ice Garden for training. In August 2015, the Penguins and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) opened the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, combining a new team practice and training facility with a UPMC Sports Medicine treatment and research complex, in suburban Cranberry Township near the interchange between Interstate 79 and Pennsylvania Route 228.[93] The twin rink facility replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility, freeing up the Consol Energy Center for other events on days the Penguins are not scheduled to play.[94] As with most other NHL arenas, the Penguins make use of a goal horn whenever the team scores a goal at home. It is also played just before the beginning of a home game, and after a Penguins victory. Their current goal horn made by Nathan Manufacturing, Inc. and introduced in 2005 to coincide with Sidney Crosby joining the team, was used at both the Civic Arena and the Consol Energy Center.[95][96]",What replaced the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility?,"The UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, which opened in August 2015, replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility.",Specific information questions,General Info and History of Pittsburgh/CMU,UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex

            Whiting Award-winner Marcia Douglas is joined by World Literature connoisseur Anderson Tepper to discuss her forthcoming book, The Jamaica Kollection of the Shante Dream Arkive, a startling new dream-like vision of Jamaica to be released April 2025. The Shante Dream Arkive brings alive a mosaic of characters—all searching through history for something or someone lost to the island: a mother searches for her missing child through time and space; an undocumented migrant struggles with loss while living in the US; a youth wanders through dream-gates seeking liberation and the lost parts of himself.

2024_Operating_Budget.pdf,"What is the Operating Budget? The Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year. Reported within this document are  figures related to planned expenditures and projected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year. Expenditures are  spread across all City Departments, Bureaus, and Elected Offices. These expenditures represent costs for the  administration and distribution of governmental services. These services include, but are not limited to: public  safety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and  programming for local parks and community recreation centers. In addition, the General Fund also supports the  routine administration of local government that includes employee wages and health benefits, workers’  compensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service. The City collects revenues to finance the costs associated with delivering services to residents. Revenues are  collected by the City from the levy of taxes, collection of fees related to the issuance of permits and licenses,  charges for services provided by City Departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other  revenue generating mechanisms.  The Operating Budget combines information relating to expenditures and revenues, creating a plan as to what  governmental services can be executed by the City and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal  year. The detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in  delivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed. The Operating Budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the Mayor and  Members of City Council. Laws established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict how much money the  City of Pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses. As a result, the City of  Pittsburgh must balance the demands for services against the available resources that it can legally acquire  through tax and non-tax revenue generating mechanisms. Given the reality of scarce resources, the City must  prioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the  City. The level of funding allocated to individual Departments and programs within the City clearly exhibits  priorities set by the City’s elected public officials. Finally, the Operating Budget can be viewed as a legally binding document. All of the costs incurred by the City of  Pittsburgh in providing day-to-day public services must be paid for out of the Operating Budget. Therefore, the  City of Pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document. The Operating  Budget can only be altered through a series of formal processes, which parallel those enacted in the initial  creation of the plan. Basis of Accounting The General Fund budget is adopted on a cash basis of accounting, meaning that the City of Pittsburgh  recognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid. The Fiscal Year The City of Pittsburgh’s fiscal year begins on the first day of January and ends on the last day of December of  each year. This can only be changed by ordinance. Balanced Budget Mandate The City’s Home Rule Charter requires that the annual Operating Budget be balanced, with estimated revenues  equal to or greater than estimated expenditures. Should revenues exceed expenditures at the end of a fiscal year,  the budget surplus is transferred into the City’s reserve fund balance.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide 20",What is the purpose of the Operating Budget according to the provided text?,"The Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year, combining information on expenditures and revenues to outline what governmental services the City can execute and deliver to the public.",Basic factual questions,General Info and History of Pittsburgh/CMU,The Operating Budget plans the city's finances and services for the current fiscal year.

pirates_wiki_text.csv,"   History[edit] Main article: History of the Pittsburgh Pirates Professional baseball in the Pittsburgh area began in 1876 with the organization of the Allegheny Base Ball Club, an independent (non-league) club based in a then-separate city called Allegheny City, across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. The team joined the minor league International Association in 1877, only to fold the following season.[8] On October 15, 1881, Denny McKnight held a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club,[9] which began play in 1882 as a founding member of the American Association. Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh,[10] the team was listed as ""Allegheny"" in the standings, and was sometimes called the ""Alleghenys"" (rarely the ""Alleghenies"") in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887.[11]",In what year did the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh first begin playing as a founding member of the American Association?,The Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh began play in 1882 as a founding member of the American Association.,Basic factual questions,Music and Culture,1882

The 2025 History Maker Honorees will be announced soon – check this space for updates!

The 32nd annual History Makers Award Dinner, presented by BNY, will take place on Thursday, June 5, at the Heinz History Center.



Since 1992, the Heinz History Center has honored exceptional individuals whose accomplishments, while rooted here in Western Pa., transcend geographic bounds. History Makers profoundly contribute to the innovative history and collective heritage of our region and represent a commitment to excellence that has defined our community. The History Center is proud to celebrate such individuals and to share their remarkable stories.

Funding raised from the Award Dinner helps to preserve our regional history for future generations and provide a space where experiences and learning moments for all ages help make memories that last a lifetime. The History Center tells the stories of Western Pennsylvanians whose hard work, innovation, enterprise, creativity, and courage improved the world and still serves to guide and inspire us today. Like our History Makers, we are encouraged (but not surprised) by stories of Pittsburgh’s can-do spirit and kindness. After all—we are home to “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.”

https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Safety/Alerts/Public-Safety-Press-Release-Archive,"  PITTSBURGH, PA, (August 12, 2021) -- In recent weeks, the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety implemented a pilot project on the South Side to address mounting concerns regarding overcrowding, increased violence, and pedestrian safety on and around East Carson Street.  The primary intent of the plan has been to stem the flow of vehicle traffic into the commercial corridor to alleviate some of the density in the area during the busiest evening hours on the weekends.  While the strategy has been largely successful in helping to prevent violence and congestion on East Carson Street, Public Safety has remained in ongoing discussion with business owners who have asked for slight adjustments to ensure ease of access to restaurants and retail stores in the early evening hours.   With that in mind, Public Safety is making modifications to the times of day during which the measures will be implemented.  Beginning at 9:30 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, East Carson Street will convert from two-way to one-way traffic traveling eastbound (outbound) between S. 10th and S. 18th. The previous start time was 7:00 p.m.    On Fridays and Saturdays, 'No Parking' measures will be strictly enforced on these blocks of East Carson Street starting at 8 p.m., including the towing of vehicles, to keep this stretch clear for Public Safety vehicle access. Signage along East Carson will be clearly marked to reflect the altered parking hours for these days.  Side streets from S.11th to S.17th will remain open to through-traffic until 9:30 p.m., at which time vehicles will be diverted around those streets via either Muriel Street or Sarah Street. In previous weeks, the side streets were closed at 7:00 p.m.  ""The only way to ensure the South Side will remain safe and accessible to everyone will be to continue to engage in communication with residents and business owners, working together and truly listening to their needs, balanced with the overall goal of preventing violence. That dialogue will be open and ongoing, and we continue to thank everyone for their patience and cooperation,"" said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich.  The pilot project in the South Side will remain in effect for the near future and Public Safety will continue to monitor its impact and effectiveness.   12/8/2021 12:41:47   Public Safety Temporarily Pauses South Side Traffic Pilot During Building Demolition","What changes are being implemented to traffic flow on East Carson Street beginning August 12, 2021?","Beginning at 9:30 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, East Carson Street will convert to one-way eastbound traffic between S. 10th and S. 18th, with 'No Parking' measures enforced starting at 8 p.m., and side streets diverted at 9:30 p.m.",Document-enhanced questions,General Info and History of Pittsburgh/CMU,"East Carson Street will be one-way eastbound between S. 10th and S. 18th Fridays and Saturdays, starting August 12, 2021; 'No Parking' enforced at 8 p.m., side street diversions at 9:30 p.m."

https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Safety/Alerts/Public-Safety-Press-Release-Archive,"  13/12/2019 14:36:11   Public Safety Statement on First Night 2020  PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 26, 2019) – A Pittsburgh tradition will continue Tuesday, Dec. 31 when the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust hosts “First Night 2020” events at venues throughout Downtown. First Night events always attract large crowds to the Golden Triangle. As such, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich reminds everyone to have fun, but also to be safe and law-abiding. “By working with our partners at the Cultural Trust, the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership and regional law enforcement departments, Pittsburgh Public Safety will be there to assure a safe experience for all,” Hissrich said. “First Night is a special night in Pittsburgh. We’re going to keep it that way. Anyone interested in engaging in illegal activities is advised to just stay home.” Hissrich warned against an unsafe New Year’s Eve tradition in many large cities: Shooting guns into the air. What goes up must come down, and the results are tragic when people are hit by celebratory gunfire. Police will observe ShotSpotter activations throughout the city and officers will arrest anyone caught discharging a firearm in public. Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will work with partnering law enforcement agencies -- including the Pennsylvania State Police, State Park Rangers, Port Authority Police, the Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office and the Allegheny County Police -- to provide uniformed and plainclothes officers throughout First Night venues. The Mounted Unit and River Rescue also will be present. Police urge people to never drink and drive. Officers will be actively looking for impaired drivers. As a reminder, city law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of a structure.

steelers_wiki_text.csv,"   History Further information: History of the Pittsburgh Steelers See also: American football in Western Pennsylvania Rooney family era (1933–present) The Steelers first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23–2 to the New York Giants.[6] Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 (1936).[12] Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White, a future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions.[6][13] Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers.[14] During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season, they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the ""Phil-Pitt Eagles"" and were known as the ""Steagles"". This team went 5–4–1.[15] In 1944, they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the ""Carpets"").[6] This team finished 0–10, marking the only winless team in franchise history.[16] The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947, tying for first place in the division at 8–4 with the Philadelphia Eagles. This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field, which the Steelers lost 21–0.[17] That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a ""Playoff Bowl"" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff.[18] In 1970, the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL–NFL merger, the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league.[19] The Steelers also received a $3 million ($24.3 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team.[20]",What was the name of the team formed in 1943 when the Steelers merged with the Philadelphia Eagles?,"In 1943, the Steelers merged with the Philadelphia Eagles, forming the team known as the 'Phil-Pitt Eagles,' also referred to as the 'Steagles'.",Specific information questions,Sports,Phil-Pitt Eagles (or Steagles)
steelers_wiki_text.csv,"  Newspaper The Steelers Digest is the only official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers.[221] It has been published for 22 years and is currently published by Dolphin/Curtis Publishing in Miami, Florida, which also handles several other publications. The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season. There are typically 24 issues of the paper within a publishing year. The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers.com page.  Usage in popular culture The Steelers' success over several decades has permeated film and literature. The Steelers are portrayed in the following big-budget Hollywood films:  The January 11, 1975, episode of the Mary Tyler Moore Show featured Super Bowl IX (featuring the Steelers) as a plot device.[222] Black Sunday in 1977[223] Heaven Can Wait in 1978[224] Smokey and the Bandit II in 1980[225] Fighting Back in 1980[226] Hey Kid, Catch! in 1980[227] ...All the Marbles in 1981 Evening Shade (TV series) 1990–1994[228] The Waterboy cameo by Bill Cowher in 1998[229] The Longest Yard in 2005 The Chief a theater production. Black and Yellow in 2010.[230] The Dark Knight Rises in 2012 features several Steelers players as the fictional Gotham Rogues, which was filmed in Heinz Field[231][232] Mad Men's April 14, 2013, episode has Don Draper, Pete Campbell and Roger Sterling meeting with two HJ Heinz executives. The executives are told that not only would the ad firm have given them tickets to the Steelers' November 19, 1967, game at the Giants, the firm would have worked it so that the Steelers would have won (they lost 20–28). Concussion in 2015 features players from the team suffering from CTE.[233] The protagonist of John Grisham's novel The Associate is a staunch Steelers fan.[234] In the summer of 2019, the Kennywood theme park located near Pittsburgh, opened a new land themed to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Steelers Country, featuring a major record-breaking coaster, the Steel Curtain.[235] The land, in addition to this ride, features a Steelers-themed experience, and an 'End Zone Restaurant'.",What is the name of the official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers?,The Steelers Digest is the only official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers and has been published for 22 years.,Specific information questions,Sports,Steelers Digest
steelers_wiki_text.csv,"  Rivals The Pittsburgh Steelers have three primary rivals, all within their division: (Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Ravens, and Cincinnati Bengals). They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post-season battles in the past, most notably the Las Vegas Raiders, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, and Tennessee Titans. They also have an intrastate rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles, but under the current scheduling the teams play each other only once every four years.[105][106][107]","Besides their divisional rivals, which teams do the Pittsburgh Steelers have rivalries with based on past postseason battles?","The Pittsburgh Steelers have rivalries with the Las Vegas Raiders, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, and Tennessee Titans due to past postseason battles.",Specific information questions,Sports,"Raiders, Cowboys, Broncos, Patriots, and Titans."

Sports in Pittsburgh have been played dating back to the American Civil War. Baseball, hockey, and the first professional American football game had been played in the city by 1892. Pittsburgh was first known as the ""City of Champions"" when the Pittsburgh Pirates, Pittsburgh Panthers football team, and Pittsburgh Steelers won multiple championships in the 1970s.[1] Today, the city has three major professional sports franchises, the Pirates, Steelers, and Penguins; while the University of Pittsburgh Panthers compete in a Division I Power Five conference, the highest level of collegiate athletics in the United States, in both football and basketball. Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris also field Division I teams in men's and women's basketball and Division I FCS teams in football. Robert Morris also fields Division I men's and women's ice hockey teams. Pittsburgh's major teams have seen great success, with the MLB's Pirates winning 5 World Series titles, the NHL's Penguins winning 5 Stanley Cups, and the NFL's Steelers winning a tied league record 6 Super Bowls. The Pittsburgh Panthers have also been successful in the NCAA with 9 national championships in football and 2 in basketball. The flag of Pittsburgh is colored with black and gold, based on the colors of William Pitt's coat of arms; Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States in which all professional sporting teams share the same colors. The city's first National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates, and that team's non-NHL predecessor, the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets, wore black and gold as their colors in the 1920s. The colors were adopted by founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Art Rooney, in 1933. In 1948, the Pittsburgh baseball Pirates switched their colors from red and blue to black and gold. Pittsburgh's second NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Penguins, wore blue and white, due to then-general manager Jack Riley's upbringing in Ontario. In 1979, after the Steelers and Pirates had each won their respective league championships, the Penguins altered their color scheme to match, despite objections from the Boston Bruins,[2][3] who have used the black and gold combination since the 1935–36 NHL season.[4][5] In 1975, late Steelers radio broadcaster Myron Cope invented the Terrible Towel, which has become ""arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team.""[6] Cope was one of multiple sports figures born in Pittsburgh and its surrounding area; others include golfer Arnold Palmer, Olympian and retired professional wrestler Kurt Angle, and basketball player Jack Twyman.  Pittsburgh is also sometimes called the ""Cradle of Quarterbacks""[7][8] due to the number of prominent players of that position who hail from the area, including NFL greats Jim Kelly, George Blanda, Johnny Unitas, Joe Namath, Dan Marino, and Joe Montana.",What is the origin of Pittsburgh's shared black and gold color scheme among its professional sports teams?,"Pittsburgh's professional sports teams share the black and gold color scheme due to a gradual adoption starting with the Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art Rooney in 1933, followed by the Pirates in 1948, and finally the Penguins in 1979, despite objections from the Boston Bruins.",Specific information questions,Sports,"Pittsburgh's black and gold colors originated with the Steelers (1933), followed by the Pirates (1948), and Penguins (1979), despite Bruins opposition."
steelers_wiki_text.csv,"  Civil rights advocacy The franchise, along with the Rooney family have for generations been strong advocates for equality of opportunity for both minorities and women. Among these achievements of the Steelers was the first to hire an African-American assistant coach (September 29, 1957, with Lowell Perry), the first to start an African-American quarterback (December 3, 1973, with Joe Gilliam),[a] the first team to boast of an African-American Super Bowl MVP (January 12, 1975, with Franco Harris), the first to hire an African-American Coordinator (September 2, 1984, with Tony Dungy), the first owner to push for passage of an ""equal opportunity"" mandating that at least one minority candidate is given an interview in all head coach hiring decisions throughout the league (the Rooney Rule in the early 2000s), and the first to hire a female as full-time athletic trainer (Ariko Iso on July 24, 2002).[99]",What significant milestone did the Pittsburgh Steelers achieve in 1984 regarding diversity within their coaching staff?,"The Pittsburgh Steelers were the first team to hire an African-American Coordinator, with Tony Dungy, on September 2, 1984.",Specific information questions,Sports,The Steelers hired Tony Dungy as the first African-American Coordinator in 1984.

https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/roberto-clemente-pittsburghs-hero/,"      Why Pittsburgh Loves Roberto Clemente  Clemente was not only known for his baseball talent, he was also known for giving back to the community. He was very involved in delivering relief packages to to the people of Managua, Nicaragua after they were affected by a earthquake. Clemente learned that some of the aid packages weren't making it to the victims so he accompanied the team to Nicaragua on the 4th relief flight on New Years Eve. The plane crashed due to mechanical errors, and Roberto Clemente and the four others on the plane died. The baseball world was forever changed. Clemente is honored all throughout Pittsburgh. A bridge is named after him, PNC Park has a statue dedicated to him, and there is a Roberto Clemente Museum. The Pirates and Major League Baseball do so much to honor this national hero. They have an award named after him ""The Clemente Award"" that is presented to the player who ""best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, and community involvement"".

pgh_sports_wiki_text.csv,"  Pittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010. The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city's first NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates, from 1925 to 1930. The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League.[20] In 1961, Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera. Founded, by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 NHL expansion, the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception—first at the Civic Arena, and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena.[21] The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009.[22] The teams included players Mark Recchi, Kevin Stevens, Jaromír Jágr, and Mario Lemieux.[23] Lemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997.[24][25] He suffered from multiple injuries, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, throughout his career.[26] In 1999, Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy. He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner of the modern era.[27] The Penguins, led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby, returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the franchise's third Cup in 2009.[28] The franchise recorded their fourth and fifth Stanley Cups consecutively in 2016 and 2017.",What significant event occurred in 1999 regarding the Pittsburgh Penguins franchise?,"In 1999, Mario Lemiux purchased the Pittsburgh Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy.",Specific information questions,Sports,"Mario Lemieux bought the Penguins, averting bankruptcy."

pgh_sports_wiki_text.csv,"   Pirates broadcaster Bob Prince, after a comeback[9]  Prior to 1876, three amateur Pittsburgh baseball teams—the Enterprise, the Xanthas, and the Olympics—competed, most often at Recreation Park.[10] On April 15, 1876, Recreation Park was the site of a game between the Xanthas and the Pittsburgh Alleghenies (alternately spelled ""Alleghenys""[11]), an unrelated forerunner to the ""Alleghenys"" team which would later be renamed the Pirates.  The Alleghenies won the game 7–3.[12] The 1877 squad was the most successful yet, finishing within 1 game of the pennant in the International Association; only a Canadian team had a better record, allowing the city potential bragging rights for being the best American team that season. 1882 marked the first ""major league"" and fully professional season for the Pittsburgh Alleghenies (Pirates) and in 1887, the Alleghenies moved from American Association to the National League after owner William Nimick became frustrated over a contract dispute.[13] The Pirates were purchased in 1900 by Barney Dreyfuss, who would go down in history as the ""Father of the modern World Series"" and its precursor, the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup, both of which saw the Pirates participate in the inaugural series. He recruited Hall of Famers Fred Clarke and Pittsburgh native Honus Wagner and built the first concrete and steel (first ""modern"") baseball stadium, Forbes Field. Under Dreyfuss, the Pirates won pre-World Series world titles in 1901 and 1902, National League pennants from 1901–1903, 1909, 1925 and 1927 and World Series in 1909 and 1925.  The 1902 squad set major league records for winning percentage and even today is the second most winning team ever fielded in the sport.[14] The franchise won the World Series three more times— in 1960, 1971, and 1979.  In 1960, the team became the first to win a World Series on a walk-off home run, hit by Bill Mazeroski, and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game.  In 1979, the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team, coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit, winning three games in a row when facing elimination, for the title.  Thus the Pirates became (and they currently remain) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit.  The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards:  Seasonal (Willie Stargell, co-MVP with Keith Hernandez), All Star Game (Dave Parker), NLCS (Willie Stargell), and World Series (Willie Stargell) within a single season.[15]  Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times:  six in the 1970s, and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992.  Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 (Dick Groat), 1966 (Roberto Clemente), 1978 (Dave Parker), 1979 (Willie Stargell), 1990 (Barry Bonds), 1992 (Barry Bonds), and 2013 (Andrew McCutchen) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 (Vernon Law) and 1990 (Doug Drabek).  In 2001, the team opened PNC Park on the city's North Shore, regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country. In addition to the Pirates, the Pittsburgh Stogies, Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915.  The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915.[16] The Pittsburgh Keystones, Homestead Grays (playing in the city limits), and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues. With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles—the most by any Negro league team[1]—including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945. The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633 winning percentage, with a line-up including Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936, with the 1935 team judged by some[who?] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues, or perhaps in baseball period.  Just as they initially played in the first ""modern"" ballpark in the majors (Forbes Field), Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete ""modern"" stadium in the Negro leagues, with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29, 1932.[17]",What accomplishment is unique to the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates in the history of all sports?,The 1979 Pirates are unique in all of sports history as the only franchise to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit.,Time-sensitive questions,Sports,The only franchise to win a title after trailing 3-1.
