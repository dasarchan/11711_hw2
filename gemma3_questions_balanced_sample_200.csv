https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Sustainability/Resilient-Pittsburgh,"         Resilient Pittsburgh Why does Pittsburgh need resilience? Air quality issues. Inequality. Public health challenges. Flash floods. Infrastructure failure. Extreme weather. There are just a few of the chronic stressors and acute shocks that challenge and threaten Pittsburgh. Though Pittsburgh has made significant progress in improving environmental stewardship and transitioning from a city in decline to a thriving hub of innovation, technology, education and medicine, we recognize there is still a need for focused, inclusive efforts to ensure all Pittsburgh residents and visitors live well and succeed. In 2014, the City of Pittsburgh joined the 100 Resilient Cities Network, powered by the Rockefeller Foundation, and with the support of the RAND Corporation, has since engaged with more than 2,000 Pittsburghers to understand the City's resilience challenges and develop analyses, reports and actions to address them. Pittsburgh's Preliminary Resilience Assessment(PDF, 28MB)  Pittsburgh Equity Indicators The City of Pittsburgh began the Pittsburgh Equity Indicators project in 2017 to assess annual progress toward equitable opportunities and outcomes for Pittsburghers of all races, genders and incomes, and to inform the City's investment decisions. Support by funding and guidance from the City University of New York Institute for State and Local Governance, the research team led by the RAND Corporation developed a framework and associated indicators to measure equality in both outcomes and opportunities in Pittsburgh. Platform Partners The City of Pittsburgh received technical support and resources from a variety of organizations and companies to strengthen particular areas of concern including stormwater management, cybersecurity, mobility, air quality, waste and energy production. These partnerships include:",Why did the City of Pittsburgh join the 100 Resilient Cities Network in 2014?,"The City of Pittsburgh joined the 100 Resilient Cities Network in 2014 to address chronic stressors and acute shocks such as air quality issues, inequality, flash floods, and infrastructure failure, and to ensure all residents live well and succeed.",Specific information questions,General Info and History of Pittsburgh/CMU

Pittsburgh Public Safety received equipment for its Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), including 150 CERT kits, 150 safety vests, 150 disaster preparedness starter kits and 20 personal bleeding control kits valued at $18,922. ""Community Emergency Response Teams assist as an integral part of a larger system that promotes safer, stronger neighborhoods and communities,” said Barbara M. Morello, Supervisor/CERT Instructor with Pittsburgh’s Public Safety Department. “The CERT program helps to train individuals in the local community to be better prepared to respond to an emergency situation in their home, school, or workplace. By placing the focus on an all-hazards approach of preparedness planning efforts on capacities and capabilities in Public Safety, increasing awareness to reach a whole community approach ultimately mitigates the consequences of a disaster.""   Also receiving grants were: Moon Volunteer Fire Department, which received equipment for its rescue truck valued at $12,803; North Fayette Township Volunteer Fire Department, which received a gear washer valued at $11,519; and West Deer Volunteer Fire Company #2, which received a brush skid unit valued at $11,090. “We want to thank our donors who help us provide these lifesaving tools,” said Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation Executive Director Robin Peters. “Our first responders are our heroes and we want to be sure they have the tools and technology they need to protect their communities.” Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich attended the grant ceremony today at the Firehouse Subs in Robinson Town Centre with Morello, Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert and Assistant Public Safety Director Shatara Murphy. Hissrich noted that the grant allows Public Safety to allocate $18,922 to other pressing needs, and called the grant “incredibly valuable and important.” Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation was created in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when Firehouse Subs founders, Chris Sorensen and Robin Sorensen, travelled to Mississippi to provide food to first responders and hurricane survivors. Certain they could do more, they started Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation with the mission of providing funding, lifesaving equipment and educational opportunities to first responders and public safety departments. The non-profit has granted more than $35 million to organizations in 47 states, Puerto Rico and Canada, including $581,000 in Pennsylvania, since its inception.

https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Safety/Alerts/Public-Safety-Press-Release-Archive,"  5/8/2018 21:05:44   ALERT: Police Arrest Carjacking Suspects  PITTSBURGH, PA (August 8, 2018) -- Pittsburgh Police officers arrested several juveniles on carjacking charges -- thanks in large part to help from the public -- including one male teen suspected of a carjacking spree. Around 1:45 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 7, Zone 4 units responded to a report of a male who had been carjacked in the 7300 block of Reynolds Street. The 66-year-old victim was assaulted and physically removed from his 2015 blue Subaru Forrester by three male teens. The victim's car was last seen heading into Homewood. While searching for the car, officers asked construction/road crews in the area to keep an eye out for the vehicle. At 4:52 p.m., officers patrolling Homewood were flagged down by a construction worker who saw the blue Forrester moments before. Officers caught-up to the vehicle. A female and four males fled from the vehicle on Monticello Street near Brushton Avenue. All five juveniles were located and arrested. The driver was identified as a 14-year-old male who was also arrested on charges he carjacked a vehicle from a 75-year-old male on the 500 block S. Murtland Avenue on Monday. In addition, the 14-year-old is charged in the carjacking of a vehicle from a 70-year-old female on Monday in the parking garage at Bakery Square. High-quality images taken at Bakery Square show the 14-year-old. Police found the shirt the teen was wearing during the Bakery Square carjacking inside the blue Forrester.  An alert citizen in Frick Park photographed the teen and others moments before they carjacked the blue Forrester. The teen was wearing the same shirt in those photos as he was during the carjacking in Bakery Square. The 14-year-old is in Shuman Juvenile Detention Center. These arrests were the result of excellent teamwork by Zones 4 and 5, K-9, and citizens.

2024_Operating_Budget.pdf,"Five-Year Financial Forecast In addition to developing the budget, OMB and the Department of Finance are responsible for estimating both  expenditures and revenues for the four years following the next fiscal year. Together, these estimates comprise  the five-year financial forecast reported in the budget document. The five-year forecast allows City Officials to evaluate the fiscal health of the City for a longer period of time. This  aids in identifying any future trends related to revenues and/or expenditures that may have an immediate or long- term impact on City operations. In addition, the five-year plan is used by City decision makers when planning for  long-term strategies, formulating departmental and citywide initiatives, and developing new policies that might  result in a financial impact. The financial forecast is an essential tool in maintaining financial discipline, thus  ensuring the delivery of essential services to residents of the City of Pittsburgh. Revenue Forecast Revenues represent the available resources afforded to the City to carry out basic administrative operations and  deliver services to City residents. The ability of the City of Pittsburgh to generate revenue is governed by the  rights afforded to the City under its Home Rule Charter and by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Projected future year expenditures are directly influenced by future year revenues projections. The Department of Finance utilizes a variety of techniques and information sources to develop revenue forecasts.  Previous years’ financial data is used to forecast growth for major tax and non-tax revenues. Monthly and end-of- year financial data related to all revenues are archived and updated in the City’s enterprise resource planning  (ERP) system. This information is then analyzed through statistical methods to ascertain growth in each revenue  line. Where applicable, the City then applies a growth rate to each revenue line. In addition to the previous years’ financial data, the City consults with IHS Markit to forecast regional economic  variables. These economic variables help to inform how various aspects of the economy can affect revenue  generating activity in the City. The City also incorporates data from federal government agencies such as the  Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and organizations such as Fannie Mae, the  National Association of Realtors, and RealSTATs. Revenue projections are finalized after a series of meetings with various stakeholders related to the City of  Pittsburgh’s Operating Budget. The City Controller verifies that budgetary assumptions and estimates are  developed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and that revenue assumptions are  reasonable. Following consensus by all stakeholders in the budget development process, the revenue projections  are finalized and incorporated into the five-year financial forecast. Expenditure Forecast OMB is responsible for developing the expenditure projections for the five-year forecast. To develop these  forecasts OMB first enters all known future year expenditures into its budget management software. These known  expenditures are those that are either contractual (professional service contracts, debt service payments, pension  contributions, etc.) or generally predictable (staffing levels in each department, citywide salary increases, etc.). OMB then develops forecasts which consider past year expenditure data and future growth, strategies, and  initiatives. While most costs remain relatively static some expenditures lines, such as healthcare and fuel, are  subject to growth in future years. These increases are largely a product of costs rising in the private market. This  is accounted for in the financial forecast by applying a percentage growth each year based on trend, Lastly, the Directors of each City division present any requests that are not captured by the methods described  above. These requests are often related to software, equipment, or personnel and are regarded to be essential in  achieving the goals or augmenting the services of each individual Department. OMB compiles all such requests  and evaluates how they relate to the Mayor’s strategic initiatives. Subject to available funds, those requests that  fall in line with the citywide initiatives are funded in each respective division’s budget in the five-year forecast.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide 27",What is the primary purpose of the five-year financial forecast for the City of Pittsburgh?,"The five-year financial forecast allows City Officials to evaluate the fiscal health of the City for a longer period of time, aiding in identifying future trends and informing long-term strategies.",Specific information questions,General Info and History of Pittsburgh/CMU

https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/troy-hill-neighborhood-guide/,"       DRINK  Whew, all that walking and stairclimbing made me thirsty. Luckily, Troy Hill is home to Penn Brewery, Pittsburgh's oldest craft brewery dating back all the way to 1986. If you love German brews, start with their flagship Penn Pilsner or Penn Dark (my personal fave) or look for specialty styles like their pumpkin roll or Oktoberfest depending on when you visit. Their beautiful outdoor biergarten is the perfect place to sip and enjoy their menu of both German and Pittsburgh favorites from potato pancakes and pork schnitzel to pierogi and french fries on your salad. I know this is technically in Spring Garden, but Threadbare Cider is an easy add to your Troy Hill itinerary while you're in the neighborhood. On the menu are refreshing, delicious ciders including pear, cherry, pineapple and northern spy, plus new creations like their lemonade cider crushers and canned ciders, too. Another great all-in-one location, you can stay here for evening as you sip ciders and enjoy fresh pizzas in their cute indoor space or spacious outdoor seating. De Fer serves up great coffee and tea all across the city, but their Troy Hill location is easily my favorite. The interior, decorated by Burgh-based artist Baron Batch, is bright, filled with art and maybe has the best vibes in the entire city. Grab a bag of coffee to tag home as a souvenir, but before you leave, head up to the rooftop deck for a 360-degree view of all of Troy Hill.",What are some of the beer options available at Penn Brewery in Troy Hill?,"Penn Brewery offers a variety of German brews including their flagship Penn Pilsner and Penn Dark, alongside specialty styles like pumpkin roll and Oktoberfest, alongside a menu of German and Pittsburgh favorites.",Document-enhanced questions,Music and Culture

https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/25-famous-pittsburgh-bridges/,"             McKees Rocks Bridge  This bridge is one of the most unique in the county because of its variety of spans. This rather long bridge features a trussed arch, Warren deck truss span and crescent arch spans. The crescents are two of only a few in North America.      Ways to See Pittsburgh's Bridges  There's plenty of ways to see The City of Bridges. For starters, I recommend the self-guided Bridges & River Shores Walking Tour from our friends at Pittsburgh Histories & Landmarks Foundation. It gives you a nice overview of Downtown and the North Shore and is easy to squeeze into any itinerary. Want to tour our bridges from below? Take the Uniquely Pittsburgh Sightseeing Tour aboard the Explorer riverboat. Fantastic photo-ops abound as you tour our three rivers and get iconic bridge shots you can only take from the water. For the adventurers, I highly recommend the Bridges in the Burgh Tour from Bike The Burgh. This nine-mile ride takes cyclists over four bridges as they discover river trails, new neighborhoods and historic landmarks.",What unique features distinguish the McKees Rocks Bridge?,"The McKees Rocks Bridge is unique due to its variety of spans, including a trussed arch, Warren deck truss span, and crescent arch spans, with the latter being two of only a few found in North America.",Document-enhanced questions,General Info and History of Pittsburgh/CMU

The applicant follows up with staff and responds to the comments by updating the design accordingly. City Planning staff will summarize the Design Review, including comments from CDAP and subsequent revisions, to convey design feedback and guidance to the Planning Commission, as the final approval determines. In some situations, projects will be reviewed twice by CDAP. At the second meeting, the project representative presents changes since the last meeting and provides additional visuals on the project as the design has developed.

https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Safety/Alerts/Public-Safety-Press-Release-Archive,"  26/12/2019 14:26:48   Public Safety Statement on Passing of Glenn Cannon  PITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 20, 2020) -- It was with great sadness today that Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich and the entire City of Pittsburgh Public Safety family learned of the passing of former Director Glenn M. Cannon, Esq. “Few people in the history of our city can match Mr. Cannon in terms of contributions to Pittsburgh and Public Safety,” Director Hissrich said. “He was an extraordinary man who lived an exemplary life. His legacy lives on today as the creator and first leader of the city’s EMS department, and in countless other ways. This is a great loss. Glenn Cannon was a great man and a great Pittsburgher.” Mr. Cannon began his Pittsburgh public service career in 1975 when Mayor Pete Flaherty named him to oversee a citywide mobile intensive care/advanced life support ambulance system, which would become the Emergency Medical Services Department. He led the newly-created Pittsburgh EMS from 1975 to 1986. During that time, he established the city’s first River Rescue Unit, first Specialized Rescue Units and the City’s first Hazardous Materials Response Team. “He was a visionary with a keen sense of detail,” said EMS Chief Ron Romano, who was hired by Cannon in 1978. In 1986, Mayor Richard Caliguiri appointed Mr. Cannon to the position of Public Safety Director, a role in which he led nearly 2,700 employees in Police, Fire, EMS, Building Inspection and Administration and 911. He also served as the City’s Emergency Management Coordinator. He served as Public Safety Director until 1992. “He was a great Public Safety Director, very hands on and very active,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “This is a loss for his family and friends, and my heart goes out to them. It’s also a loss for Public Safety and the city.” Following his Pittsburgh career, Mr. Cannon worked extensively in emergency management at county, state and federal levels. Director Hissrich, a former EMS medic, worked under Mr. Cannon when he was Public Safety Director. “I personally witnessed his leadership at the Bloomfield Train Derailment in 1987 and the Ashland Oil Spill in 1988 while I was assigned to EMS's Rescue Division as a paramedic,” Hissrich said. “I saw firsthand how he was able to gain control of chaotic situations and ensure that First Responders were able to do their jobs effectively.” Mr. Cannon held degrees from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University. He was a partner in the Pittsburgh law firm of Kennedy, Cannon & DeVinney, an adjunct faculty member and Visiting Senior Lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh, and the author of numerous published professional articles.  “Glenn was truly a very good friend, leader, and mentor,” said Assistant Fire Chief Norm Auvil, a longtime friend and colleague of Mr. Cannon. “His vision and inspiration led me to focus on family, education, training and public service. He truly has guided my personal and professional path in life.” On behalf of all in Public Safety, Director Hissrich offers his deepest condolences to Mr. Cannon’s surviving family and friends.",What significant units did Glenn Cannon establish during his leadership of the Pittsburgh EMS from 1975 to 1986?,"During his time leading the Pittsburgh EMS, Glenn Cannon established the city’s first River Rescue Unit, first Specialized Rescue Units, and the City’s first Hazardous Materials Response Team.",Time-sensitive questions,General Info and History of Pittsburgh/CMU

steelers_wiki_text.csv,"  Steelers' five Super Bowl rings before 2009 Cowher led the Steelers to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons, a feat that had been accomplished only by legendary coach Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns. In those first six seasons, Cowher coached them as deep as the AFC Championship Game three times and following the 1995 season an appearance in Super Bowl XXX on the strength of the ""Blitzburgh"" defense. However, the Steelers lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX, two weeks after a thrilling AFC Championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts.[33][34] Cowher produced the franchise's record-tying fifth Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XL over the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks ten years later.[35] With that victory, the Steelers became the third team to win five Super Bowls, and the first sixth-seeded playoff team to reach and win the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team post-season tournament in 1990. He coached through the 2006 season which ended with an 8–8 record, just short of the playoffs. Overall Cowher's teams reached the playoffs 10 of 15 seasons with six AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl berths and a championship. Cowher's career record with Pittsburgh was 149–90–1 in the regular season and 161–99–1 overall, including playoff games.[36]",What notable achievement did Bill Cowher lead the Steelers to in Super Bowl XL?,"Bill Cowher led the Steelers to a Super Bowl XL victory over the Seattle Seahawks, marking the franchise's record-tying fifth Super Bowl win and making them the first sixth-seeded playoff team to win the Super Bowl since 1990.",Specific information questions,Sports

pgh_sports_wiki_text.csv,"  Pittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010. The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city's first NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates, from 1925 to 1930. The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League.[20] In 1961, Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera. Founded, by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 NHL expansion, the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception—first at the Civic Arena, and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena.[21] The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009.[22] The teams included players Mark Recchi, Kevin Stevens, Jaromír Jágr, and Mario Lemieux.[23] Lemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997.[24][25] He suffered from multiple injuries, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, throughout his career.[26] In 1999, Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy. He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner of the modern era.[27] The Penguins, led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby, returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the franchise's third Cup in 2009.[28] The franchise recorded their fourth and fifth Stanley Cups consecutively in 2016 and 2017.",What significant event occurred in 1999 regarding the Pittsburgh Penguins franchise?,"In 1999, Mario Lemiux purchased the Pittsburgh Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy.",Specific information questions,Sports
pgh_sports_wiki_text.csv,"     See also: American football in Western Pennsylvania   Main article: Pittsburgh As the home of the MLB's Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, PNC Park is located in North Shore, in front of the Allegheny River, Roberto Clemente Bridge, and the Pittsburgh city skyline. Sports in Pittsburgh have been played dating back to the American Civil War. Baseball, hockey, and the first professional American football game had been played in the city by 1892. Pittsburgh was first known as the ""City of Champions"" when the Pittsburgh Pirates, Pittsburgh Panthers football team, and Pittsburgh Steelers won multiple championships in the 1970s.[1] Today, the city has three major professional sports franchises, the Pirates, Steelers, and Penguins; while the University of Pittsburgh Panthers compete in a Division I Power Five conference, the highest level of collegiate athletics in the United States, in both football and basketball. Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris also field Division I teams in men's and women's basketball and Division I FCS teams in football. Robert Morris also fields Division I men's and women's ice hockey teams. Pittsburgh's major teams have seen great success, with the MLB's Pirates winning 5 World Series titles, the NHL's Penguins winning 5 Stanley Cups, and the NFL's Steelers winning a tied league record 6 Super Bowls. The Pittsburgh Panthers have also been successful in the NCAA with 9 national championships in football and 2 in basketball. The flag of Pittsburgh is colored with black and gold, based on the colors of William Pitt's coat of arms; Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States in which all professional sporting teams share the same colors. The city's first National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates, and that team's non-NHL predecessor, the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets, wore black and gold as their colors in the 1920s. The colors were adopted by founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Art Rooney, in 1933. In 1948, the Pittsburgh baseball Pirates switched their colors from red and blue to black and gold. Pittsburgh's second NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Penguins, wore blue and white, due to then-general manager Jack Riley's upbringing in Ontario. In 1979, after the Steelers and Pirates had each won their respective league championships, the Penguins altered their color scheme to match, despite objections from the Boston Bruins,[2][3] who have used the black and gold combination since the 1935–36 NHL season.[4][5] In 1975, late Steelers radio broadcaster Myron Cope invented the Terrible Towel, which has become ""arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team.""[6] Cope was one of multiple sports figures born in Pittsburgh and its surrounding area; others include golfer Arnold Palmer, Olympian and retired professional wrestler Kurt Angle, and basketball player Jack Twyman.  Pittsburgh is also sometimes called the ""Cradle of Quarterbacks""[7][8] due to the number of prominent players of that position who hail from the area, including NFL greats Jim Kelly, George Blanda, Johnny Unitas, Joe Namath, Dan Marino, and Joe Montana.",What is the origin of Pittsburgh's shared black and gold color scheme among its professional sports teams?,"Pittsburgh's professional sports teams share the black and gold color scheme due to a gradual adoption starting with the Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art Rooney in 1933, followed by the Pirates in 1948, and finally the Penguins in 1979, despite objections from the Boston Bruins.",Specific information questions,Sports
