Pittsburgh Police advises all fans seeking tickets to go through the Penguins or a reputable website such as Stubhub.com or Seatgeek.com. The Pens begin their first-round playoff series Wednesday against the Philadelphia Flyers at PPG Paints arena.

https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Recreation-Events/Film-Event-Management/Special-Event-Block-Party-Permitting,"    Block Party Permits  A ""block party"" means a one-day outdoor public event organized by the residents of a City block and held upon a City right-of-way for social or entertainment purposes. Block Party permits are limited to “Residential” districts as defined in the Zoning Code and limited to one (1) city block. The activities that take place at a block party are up to the imagination of the residents and can include casual conversation, cook outs, pot luck dinners, games for children, and/or entertainment. Block parties are designed to take place in the street and on the sidewalks of the requested block. To enhance the sense of community, the City allows the street to be closed to traffic. In addition, having a Block Party Permit provides an exemption from some portions of the City’s noise ordinance, thus allowing you to play music using amplifiers that would otherwise be prohibited in public. Finally, Block Party Permits are exempt from the City’s “Open Container” law, thus allowing public consumption of alcohol by attendees of legal age at an approved block party, only on the block identified by the permit. Block Party Permit applications must be submitted at least seven (7) business days prior to the event date to ensure proper time for review. Additionally, block party permits can only be written for weekends and federal holidays, and are only valid between the hours of 10:00am and 10:00pm. While not a federal holiday, block party permits can be issued for Halloween as a means for creating safe trick or treating environments in neighborhoods. All other conditions of a block party permit must still be met for those occurring on Halloween. Lastly, Block party permits cannot be issued for private events, including but not limited to: wedding receptions, birthday parties, graduations or family reunions. Block Party permits also cannot be issued to create venues for artist markets, farmers markets, or other for-profit ventures. These events can apply for Special Event Permits per the conditions of those permits. NOTE: Block Party permits are not subject to the above two-phase application process and remain a single submission application.","According to the text, what types of events are explicitly prohibited from receiving Block Party Permits?","Block Party Permits cannot be issued for private events like wedding receptions or birthday parties, or to create venues for artist or farmers markets, which must apply for Special Event Permits instead.",Specific information questions,Events in Pittsburgh and CMU

The secret sauce? This intimate (seating for MAYBE 125 max) venue is intensely dedicated to bringing in national touring acts on an almost nightly basis. Add in the cheap cost of tickets (most around $15-18), a stellar list of local drafts and creative cocktails, and this is the perfect night out. Pro Tips: Get there when the doors open and try to snag a seat as close to the stage as possible for the best, unobstructed views of the show. Bar seating makes it easy to get drinks, but likely you'll be peering around peeps to see the stage.

Signature Clayton Tour Experience: Gilded, Not Golden
Tours run Tuesdays through Sundays
About the Tour
Just announced! Gilded, Not Golden, the newly reinterpreted tour of Clayton, won a 2024 Leadership in History Award from the American Association for State and Local History.

Look beneath the “gilded” surface of the late 19th century to reveal the era's more complicated truths. Discover Pittsburgh’s influence as an industrial powerhouse through a shared dialogue about the ongoing legacies of the Gilded Age.
 
""The tour guide did an excellent job of explaining the house details, decorative arts, family history & Gilded Age, in general. I particularly liked how history of the working class was woven in as a counterpoint to the lavish lifestyle of the wealthy.""

- Claire L.


The Gilded Age was an era not only of immense wealth and progress, but also rapid industrialization, unprecedented immigration, and labor strife. Explore this pivotal time in our nation’s history at Clayton, the only remaining fully preserved Gilded Age mansion in Pittsburgh. Join your guide and other visitors for a conversational experience that shares the stories of the Frick family and other Pittsburghers, and considers how the legacy of the Gilded Age continues to affect us today.
 

Content advisory: 1892 was a tumultuous year for the Frick family and the Pittsburgh steel industry. For this reason, tours of Clayton deal with potentially challenging subject matter, including discussions of violence, grief, and child loss.

Martin Media Presents
Byham Theater
Live Music  Concert
This show will be an evening with, Herb Alpert and his brand new Tijuana Brass. Herb along with his 6 great musicians will be playing all of your favorite TJB hit songs just as you remember hearing them while growing up.

2025 will mark the 60th anniversary of the iconic album, “Whipped Cream & Other Delights”. Herb and the band will be performing many of those great songs in addition to many other hit songs that we all know; “The Lonely Bull”, “Spanish Flea”, “Taste of Honey”, “Mexican Shuffle”, “Tijuana Taxi”, “This Guy’s In Love With You”, “What Now My Love”, “Zorba the Greek”, “Ladyfingers”, “Rise” and many other delights.

The show runs 90 minutes and is informal as Herb loves to answer questions from the audience about his career, A&M Records and the many iconic artists like Sergio Mendes & Brasil 66, The Carpenters and Burt Bacharach that he has worked with over the past 63 years. The show features a giant video screen that displays hundreds of classic photos, videos, art and various memorabilia from Herb’s music career. A really exciting show and truly a Once in a Lifetime Concert Event!

This is a rental event presented by an independent organization separate from the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The Trust is committed to its core values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, including freedom of expression.

Gala Porras-Kim: The reflection at the threshold of a categorical division

Forum 90
Systems of categorization and inevitable mislabeling, material preservation and eventual degradation, and an impulse to record in the face of inherent forgetfulness—these contradictions inform Gala Porras-Kim’s (b. 1984, Bogotá, Colombia) interest in museums and their practices. In dialogue with curators at Carnegie Museum of Art over the past two years, Porras-Kim has been trawling the museum’s database to better understand its holdings and the Carnegie Institute’s evolving cataloguing systems and acquisition history. Her findings reveal overlapping areas in the collections of Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and Carnegie Public Library, where each institution stewards their objects differently—as art, science, and information respectively. Porras-Kim proposes that art is not a fixed category, and questions the conceptual frameworks and individual subjectivities that go into presenting and understanding an object as a work of art.

Gala Porras-Kim is organized by Liz Park, Richard Armstrong Curator of Contemporary Art, and Cynthia Stucki, curatorial assistant.

https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Safety/Alerts/Public-Safety-Press-Release-Archive,"  26/12/2019 14:26:48   Public Safety Statement on Passing of Glenn Cannon  PITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 20, 2020) -- It was with great sadness today that Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich and the entire City of Pittsburgh Public Safety family learned of the passing of former Director Glenn M. Cannon, Esq. “Few people in the history of our city can match Mr. Cannon in terms of contributions to Pittsburgh and Public Safety,” Director Hissrich said. “He was an extraordinary man who lived an exemplary life. His legacy lives on today as the creator and first leader of the city’s EMS department, and in countless other ways. This is a great loss. Glenn Cannon was a great man and a great Pittsburgher.” Mr. Cannon began his Pittsburgh public service career in 1975 when Mayor Pete Flaherty named him to oversee a citywide mobile intensive care/advanced life support ambulance system, which would become the Emergency Medical Services Department. He led the newly-created Pittsburgh EMS from 1975 to 1986. During that time, he established the city’s first River Rescue Unit, first Specialized Rescue Units and the City’s first Hazardous Materials Response Team. “He was a visionary with a keen sense of detail,” said EMS Chief Ron Romano, who was hired by Cannon in 1978. In 1986, Mayor Richard Caliguiri appointed Mr. Cannon to the position of Public Safety Director, a role in which he led nearly 2,700 employees in Police, Fire, EMS, Building Inspection and Administration and 911. He also served as the City’s Emergency Management Coordinator. He served as Public Safety Director until 1992. “He was a great Public Safety Director, very hands on and very active,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “This is a loss for his family and friends, and my heart goes out to them. It’s also a loss for Public Safety and the city.” Following his Pittsburgh career, Mr. Cannon worked extensively in emergency management at county, state and federal levels. Director Hissrich, a former EMS medic, worked under Mr. Cannon when he was Public Safety Director. “I personally witnessed his leadership at the Bloomfield Train Derailment in 1987 and the Ashland Oil Spill in 1988 while I was assigned to EMS's Rescue Division as a paramedic,” Hissrich said. “I saw firsthand how he was able to gain control of chaotic situations and ensure that First Responders were able to do their jobs effectively.” Mr. Cannon held degrees from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University. He was a partner in the Pittsburgh law firm of Kennedy, Cannon & DeVinney, an adjunct faculty member and Visiting Senior Lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh, and the author of numerous published professional articles.  “Glenn was truly a very good friend, leader, and mentor,” said Assistant Fire Chief Norm Auvil, a longtime friend and colleague of Mr. Cannon. “His vision and inspiration led me to focus on family, education, training and public service. He truly has guided my personal and professional path in life.” On behalf of all in Public Safety, Director Hissrich offers his deepest condolences to Mr. Cannon’s surviving family and friends.",What significant units did Glenn Cannon establish during his leadership of the Pittsburgh EMS from 1975 to 1986?,"During his time leading the Pittsburgh EMS, Glenn Cannon established the city’s first River Rescue Unit, first Specialized Rescue Units, and the City’s first Hazardous Materials Response Team.",Time-sensitive questions,General Info and History of Pittsburgh/CMU

The upper level of a two-story building sustained severe damage during heavy rainstorms and engineers are concerned the integrity of the structure, and that of the adjacent buildings, may be compromised. As such, Public Safety will be closing E. Carson Street between S.16th and S.17th streets to begin the demolition of 1604 E. Carson. A large crane has been staged in the street to begin that process. During this time, traffic will be diverted around this block. Tractor trailers and longer industrial-type vehicles will need to divert via the 10th Street Bridge or the Birmingham Bridge. As stated earlier, the traffic pilot project implemented on July 30 will NOT be in place for the time being.  Some businesses on this block will be impacted during the demolition. There is no timeline for its completion. This is an evolving situation and Public Safety will provide information to the public as it becomes available.  Public Safety would like to thank residents, business owners, and visitors to Pittsburgh for their patience and understanding with these last minute changes and the inconvenience they may cause.

The crash occurred around 4:55 p.m. on the 10th Street Bypass between the Roberto Clemente and Andy Warhol bridges. Three children were injured. The crash is under investigation. According to eyewitness and preliminary accounts, a dark-colored SUV was travelling east on the bypass when it skidded on the pavement, crashed into a concrete barrier and rolled. The SUV and a small white vehicle travelling west then collided. Bystanders, including an off-duty fireman, performed CPR on the driver of the white vehicle. Two Port Authority Police officers were first on scene, and one applied an AED to the driver. Police and EMS arrived soon after and continued the lifesaving measures. Despite their efforts, the driver, a male, was pronounced dead at Allegheny General Hospital. Four people -- a woman and three children, including a baby -- in the dark-colored SUV were injured. The mother was transported to UPMC Mercy in stable condition and the children were taken to Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC in stable condition.
