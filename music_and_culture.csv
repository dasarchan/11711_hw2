Discover the history of your ancestors at the Irish Genealogy Workshop.

Irish genealogy experts Fintan Mullan and Gillian Hunt from the Ulster Historical Foundation in Belfast are back after a one-year hiatus for the tenth annual Irish Genealogy Workshop, presented in partnership with the Westmoreland Historical Society, on March 4.

This event is now sold out. 
If you are tracing your ancestors in Ireland, a face-to-face consultation with Irish Genealogy experts Fintan Mullan or Gillian Hunt could save you a considerable amount of time and greatly increase your chances of success.

During a 30-minute consultation, you will receive research advice and guidance from Fintan or Gillian who will use their Irish family history knowledge and archival experience to help solve your family tree puzzles.

A consultation is suitable for both the beginner needing guidance on how/where to start and the more experienced researcher who has come up against a “brick wall” in their research.

A personal consultation with the Ulster Historical Foundation is the perfect way to round out a research trip as you will leave with a list of documents to examine, saving you time when you are at the archives.

These sessions are offered in partnership with the Westmoreland Historical Society, which preserves and interprets the history of Westmoreland County.

Admission
Each 30-min consultation session is $60. Individuals are permitted to purchase two consecutive consultation sessions, which results in a one-hour session.

To request accommodations or for more information, contact Sierra Green at 412-454-6361 or sgreen@heinzhistorycenter.org.

The Heinz History Center’s Rauh Jewish History Program & Archives will celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim with a one-night only, participatory experience that blends hand-crafted art and tradition.

Purim commemorates the salvation of the Jewish people in the ancient Persian empire. This is a joyous occasion that is often celebrated with storytelling, gifts, and festive meals.

Join artist Olivia Devorah as they delve into the history of the holiday from the biblical book of Esther and view traditional texts in a new light, taking inspiration from “The Witness Quilt.”

Inspired by the rich colors, textures, and life stories showcased in the Louise Silk: A Patchwork Life exhibition, the Gut Yontif: A Patchwork Holiday Experience series invites emerging artists to reimagine the themes of Sukkot, Chanukah, Tu B’Shvat, and Purim in new works of art.

Often said after the evening service that marks the start of a Jewish holiday, Gut Yontif is a Yiddish greeting that means “have a good holiday!”

Experience these holidays like never before through their unique artistic lenses.

Admission
Admission to this public program is $5 for regular visitors and FREE for History Center members.

Doors open at 6 p.m. and the experience will begin at 6:30 p.m.

Admission includes access to the Louise Silk: A Patchwork Life exhibition.

About the Artist
Olivia Devorah Tucker (they/them) is a Talmud educator, theatre collaborator, challah sculptor, and aspiring Jewish Demonologist. They have been published in Kenden Alfond’s “Feeding Women of the Talmud, Feeding Ourselves” and performed as dramaturg/meturgemon for Ella-Gabriel Mason’s “Queer Jewish: Dancing In Diaspora.” They serve as Program Coordinator / Teacher Training Fairy for SVARA: A Traditionally Radical Yeshiva, and as a co-op member of The Glitterbox Theater in their home of Pittsburgh, PA (Shawnee & Haudenosaunee land). Olivia puts the femme in ephemera & the trans in translation! Find more Olivia here.

Celebrate the joy of girlhood during a multigenerational celebration of storytelling and history.

Presented in partnership with the University of Pittsburgh’s Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, this special day focused on America’s favorite historical dolls will feature a book talk with three American Girl book series authors, a delightful tea party, paper doll making, and more.

Anchoring the program are authors Connie Porter (the ADDY WALKER® series), Jackie Greene (the REBECCA RUBIN ™ series), and Wendy Wan-Long Shang (CORINNE ® series) who will share their experiences writing the powerful narratives of these beloved characters. The trio will discuss how they framed important historical events and issues for younger audiences while also imparting lessons of resilience, friendship, and empowerment throughout.

Ahead of the book talk, kids and kids-at-heart are invited (with their dolls!) to an enchanting tea party that Samantha, Molly, and Felicity would be proud of! Enjoy light refreshments and imaginative play while you sip, savor, and socialize.

Throughout the day, you can also dip into your own childhood nostalgia and design a paper doll with the University of Pittsburgh’s Book Making Club, view girlhood-inspired artifacts in the Detre Library & Archives, learn about the American Girl Doll Lending Program at local libraries, participate in a themed scavenger hunt, and browse the Riverstone Books pop-up shop.

The 2025 History Maker Honorees will be announced soon – check this space for updates!

The 32nd annual History Makers Award Dinner, presented by BNY, will take place on Thursday, June 5, at the Heinz History Center.



Since 1992, the Heinz History Center has honored exceptional individuals whose accomplishments, while rooted here in Western Pa., transcend geographic bounds. History Makers profoundly contribute to the innovative history and collective heritage of our region and represent a commitment to excellence that has defined our community. The History Center is proud to celebrate such individuals and to share their remarkable stories.

Funding raised from the Award Dinner helps to preserve our regional history for future generations and provide a space where experiences and learning moments for all ages help make memories that last a lifetime. The History Center tells the stories of Western Pennsylvanians whose hard work, innovation, enterprise, creativity, and courage improved the world and still serves to guide and inspire us today. Like our History Makers, we are encouraged (but not surprised) by stories of Pittsburgh’s can-do spirit and kindness. After all—we are home to “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.”

Gold Sponsor: 



Please contact Angela Gaitaniella, Corporate Relations Director, at amgaitaniella@heinzhistorycenter.org for more information on ways to support the History Center through History Makers Award Dinner sponsorship.

Live Music  Concert
Tickets for this event are not currently on sale online.
The High Kings are Finbarr Clancy, Darren Holden, Brian Dunphy Paul O’ Brien. The High Kings formed in June 2007 when Brian, Darren, Finbarr and former member Martin Furey were asked to join a brand new Irish ballad group by David Kavanagh after he had noticed a gap in the market for a band specialising in traditional Irish music.

It didn’t take long during there first studio rehearsal for them to realise that the way their individual voices blended together, that they were onto something special. The High Kings play 13 instruments between them creating the unique sound and atmosphere that they still showcase to this day. This was confirmed when their self-titled debut album reached number 2 on the world Billboard Music chart. In March 2009 The High Kings played 5 consecutive sold out shows to a packed audience in Dublin’s Olympia Theatre.

Mary Black is delighted to be going back to the USA in 2025 for the first time in 8 years. Mary has become a dominant presence in Irish music, both at home and abroad, bringing her songs and music, to growing numbers of fans, not just in Ireland where she has been a household name for decades, but all over the world. As an award-winning solo artist with multiple chart-topping and critically acclaimed albums, Mary Black has been celebrated by a faithful public as well as fellow artists many of whom she has performed and recorded with over the years, including Emmylou Harris, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Joan Baez and Van Morrison (celebrated in her latest album ‘Duets'). Last year Mary received an Honorary Doctorate in Literature from UCD and RTÉ presented her with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the RTÉ Radio 1 Folk Awards. Mary and her legendary band will celebrate her career playing favourite songs from her extensive catalogue, songs that we’ve come to know and love over the years.

Supporting Act: Roisin O

This is a rental event presented by an independent organization separate from the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The Trust is committed to its core values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, including freedom of expression.

PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh
Benedum Center
Broadway & Musical Theater
The 2023 Tony-winner for best musical, based on David Lindsay-Abaire's play of the same title, revolves around a teenage girl named Kimberly Levaco, who suffers from a condition that rapidly accelerates the aging process. Before she has had a chance to venture forth into the world as an adult, she finds herself turning into an old woman.

Her story, unfolding like a dark fairy tale, is as whimsical as it is piercing. Yet the effect is powerfully life-affirming in the way it reminds audiences of the preciousness of the time we have at hand. Full of quirky humor and social satire on grownup immaturity, the musical features a score by Jeanine Tesori (music) and David Lindsay-Abaire (lyrics) that will leave you both grinning and deeply touched.

SKELETON KEY VIP 
Good Charlatan dives into the world of con artistry, pickpocketing, and real magic. The show is a hilarious and profoundly beautiful plunge into the underworld of those who use and abuse the powers of deception.


Our tour guide, Ben Seidman combines sleight of hand and psychological deception to cheat at cards, pick your pockets, and demonstrate the importance of using our powers for good. At its core, Good Charlatan questions the existence of free will and reimagines how one simple lie can unfold into a spiral of truth.

Ben Seidman guest-starred on the Netflix series Brainchild, produced by Pharrell, and starred in both Vanity Fair and WIRED’s “Experts React” series, discussing magic, sleight of hand, and pickpocketing. Ben appeared in the Vanderpump Rules Season 9 premiere, starred in two specials on Travel Channel, and appeared twice on Penn & Teller: Fool Us. While known for large events, Ben also creates amazement at small private parties, including performances for Christina Aguilera, Woody Harrelson, and Zedd. He has dazzled CEOs, senators, and the late-great Robin Williams.

Seidman was the only person in history to be named the Resident Magician at Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas. He was awarded the Princess Cruises “Entertainer of the Year” award and consulted on three seasons of Mindfreak on A&E, designing illusions for Criss Angel. Seidman taught magic to Johnny Knoxville and consulted on multiple feature films in the Jackass franchise. Internationally, he wrote and directed magic for SVT, the biggest TV channel in Sweden. Ben lives in Los Angeles with his wife Sarah and his dog Juno.

Harris Theater
Film
The lush and breathtaking beauty of the Alps, filmed with painterly grace under natural light from frigid winter to redemptive spring, provides the physical and emotional backdrop for ‘Vermiglio,’ Maura Delpero’s visionary film, which won the Silver Lion at the 2024 Venice Film Festival. This singular portrait of a sprawling family, set in the small, mountainous village of Vermiglio during the waning days of WWII, follows a series of dramatic, consequential events after the arrival of a taciturn Sicilian soldier (Giuseppe De Domenico), who hides out in town after deserting the army. While there, the soldier develops a romance with the family's eldest daughter, Lucia (Martina Scrinzi). ‘Vermiglio’ shows the lives of a provincial family in a remote village suspended in time by the customs of a fading era. Conjuring stories from her own family’s past, Delpero creates a deeply personal and human tale that recalls the great neorealist movement in Italian cinema, but through Lucia’s perspective ‘Vermiglio’ feels distinct and novel. Italy’s Official Selection for the 2025 Academy Awards.

Directed by Maura Delpero

2024 | Italy, France, Belgium | Landin and Italian language with English Subtitles | DCP

MOZART: Piano Concerto No. 22
PROKOFIEV: Symphony No. 5

About this Performance
Praised for his ""pristine, lyrical and intelligent"" playing (The New York Times), Jan Lisiecki returns to perform Mozart’s elegant and effervescent piano concerto. Prokofiev’s Fifth Symphony is filled with grand, sweeping, lyrical music tinged with brooding introspection.

When his Fifth premiered in the US, Prokofiev’s picture graced the cover of Time Magazine, and the magazine’s lengthy profile of him quoted Koussevitzky’s assessment: “[The Fifth Symphony is] the greatest musical event in many, many years. The greatest since Brahms and Tchaikovsky! It is magnificent! It is yesterday, it is today, it is tomorrow.”

The March 7th performance will be broadcast live on WQED.

Harris Theater
Film
This star studded tribute brings into focus the dazzling, complex period of Liza Minnelli’s life starting in the 1970s, just after the tragic death of her mother Judy Garland—as she confronts a range of personal and professional challenges on the way to becoming a bona fide legend. Over these years, Liza seeks out extraordinary mentors: KayThompson, Fred Ebb, Charles Aznavour, Halston, and Bob Fosse. With insightful participation from a coterie of colleagues such as Michael Feinstein, Mia Farrow, Ben Vereen, Joel Grey and the late Chita Rivera, along with the revelatory participation by the star herself, the film illuminates the contradiction of Liza Minnelli: her privilege and struggle, strength and vulnerability, unreal expectations and towering talent–the friction of which fueled her stunning rise, resilience and her enduring place as one of thegreatest, most original performers in the history of entertainment.

Classical  Live Music
Performances
MAR 8 | Sat 7:30 PM | Pre-concert festivities at 6:30 PM 

About this Performance
Forget everything you’ve heard. Join the PSO at Heinz Hall for one-of-a-kind experiences that take you deeper into the music. Whether you’re new to classical music or just want to explore the music in a new way, expect moments of fascination, guided from the stage. This performance features Prokofiev's Symphony No. 5.

Prokofiev’s Fifth Symphony, hailed as “magnificent” and “the greatest since Brahms and Tchaikovsky,” is a sweeping masterpiece of lyrical beauty and brooding introspection. Written in 1944 during the upheaval of World War II, Prokofiev's Symphony No. 5 captures the chaos and emotion of wartime life. Despite the hardship and suffering captured in the music, there is an underlying sense of hope and optimism. A lyrical longing for peace struggles against moments of darkness. Join the PSO as we dive into its history and composition and celebrate the resilience of the human spirit! 

Relaxed atmosphere | Shorter concerts | On-stage host | Signature cocktails

“I invite all our subscribers to experience Disrupt. The fantastic artists of the orchestra explore the emotion and story of the music and composers in new ways. It truly is a fascinating musical experience."" Manfred Honeck

Symphony Starter
Just starting with the symphony? We welcome you! Symphony Starters are concerts that feature our most popular programming and enhancements that make Heinz Hall even more special; like signature cocktails, meeting PSO musicians, and learning more about the music you hear.

Harris Theater
Film
Set in 1931 Berlin, M is the chilling tale of serial child murderer Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre, in a star-defining performance) and the community he terrorizes, its various strata and conceptions of justice. Opening with an unsolved murder, the film depicts a frantic hunt for the killer. With the sanctioned wheels of the lawful justice system turning, the city's criminal underworld begins to have difficulties conducting business as usual. The streets are thick with police on high alert, conducting raids at every opportunity. In response, the city's mobsters devise a vigilante plan to capture the murderer and bring him to justice themselves. The first sound film of German-Austrian master Fritz Lang, M has come to be considered the original psychological thriller, the begetter of what would come to be known as film noir — and a profound exploration of crime, punishment and justice

Directed by Fritz Lang

1931 | Germany | German language with English subtitles | 35mm

Liberty Magic
Family
Forget everything you know about magicians pulling rabbits out of top hats. Mr. Messado brings a fresh new take on the age-old art of prestidigitation. Join superstar magician Mr. Messado for his new astonishing play designed exclusively for Liberty Magic. Time tested through thousands of performances at appearances around the world, schools, company events, private parties and more, Mr. Messado’s Magic School for the Young and Young at Heart will have both teens AND adults amazed from start to finish! This 60 minute spectacular, featuring a combination of stunning magic and clean comedy, is full of interactive wonder. Whether it be shouting the magic words from the comfort of your seats or by coming up on stage to be trained as a magical assistant, every member of your party will actively participate throughout the show. Mr. Messado’s story begins on the TV screen of his grandmother’s Philadelphia living room where global stars like Michael Jackson and David Copperfield ignited a love for entertainment and storytelling. In this deeply personal, hilarious and engaging performance you’ll get to know the mister behind the magic, the rabble-rousing raconteur behind the cape, the magic mentor who is Mr. Messado.

This unique family friendly matinee takes place each Sunday at Liberty Magic, our one-of-a-kind intimate speakeasy with only 67 seats in 4 rows, typically reserved only for adults. Mr. Messado’s Magic School for the Young and Young at Heart is recommended for ages 8+. Little brothers and sisters 6 years and older can tag along. No tattletales, snitches, or cheats.

Joshua Messado started Messado Magic over 20 years ago at the Houdini’s magic theatre in Atlantic City, NJ. There he found his passion for performing and discovered the linking rings, which is now his signature effect. After Houdini’s, he co-owned a magic shop and theatre in Philadelphia, PA for several years. His career in magic led to national and international television appearances as seen on Wizard Wars with Penn and Teller, SyFy Channel (USA), Temple University TV (USA), Illusions of grandeur, OLN (Canada) and recently on Farid Magic 13, Pro7 (Germany). He’s performed at reputable theatres like the Magic Castle in Hollywood, Chicago Magic Lounge, and Monday Night Magic in New York. He is well equipped with stunning sleight of hand with comedic timing to amaze a wide variety of spectators: corporate shows, college market, resorts, celebrities, adults and children alike. References are ranging from TD Bank, Tropicana Casino to David Copperfield.

FAQ: Age Requirements. We have found that kids 5 years of age and under won't understand most of what is happening in this sophisticated magical play, and will probably start to wiggle in their seats because they don't have the attention span to sit and watch

A VISIONARY SATIRE ONCE BANISHED FROM BROADWAY

Wiletta Mayer is the preeminent Black actress of the 1950s and the star of a new show headed to Broadway, though nothing could prepare her for the culture clash that erupts between the director and her fellow cast members in rehearsal for this new, ""progressive"" play. TROUBLE IN MIND is a cutting backstage satire, a play within a play, and a case of life imitating art as playwright Alice Childress refused to let producers define her story. This visionary production should have premiered on Broadway in 1955, but didn't get its due until 2021, 66 years after its intended debut. Now, TROUBLE IN MIND comes to Pittsburgh for the first time, in a premiere destined to enthrall us all.

This show is rated PG-13. Set in 1957, it addresses themes of racism, sexism, identity, and class, and contains strong profanity and racially offensive terms. This production contains the use of haze.

Run Time: 2 hours 15 minutes, one intermission
Closed Caption available.

PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh
Benedum Center
Broadway & Musical Theater
Holding onto hope when times are tough can take an awful lot of determination, and sometimes, an awful lot of determination comes in a surprisingly small package. Little Orphan Annie has reminded generations of theatergoers that sunshine is always right around the corner, and now the best-loved musical of all time is set to return in a new production – just as you remember it and just when we need it most.

Annie, directed by Jenn Thompson, features the iconic book and score, written by Tony Award®-winners Thomas Meehan, Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin. This celebration of family, optimism and the American spirit remains the ultimate cure for all the hard knocks life throws your way.

Harris Theater
Film
With deadpan, absurdist charm, Manitoban filmmaker Matthew Rankin triangulates a group of interconnected storylines set in a wintry, bleakly beautiful Winnipeg. Two kids discover a bank note frozen in a block of ice, which they hope to retrieve to buy their classmates a new pair of glasses. A tour guide brings befuddled visitors on a walking tour of the city’s modest environs. A melancholy man (Rankin, in an autobiographical role) returns home from Montreal to reunite with his family after many years. Imagining a city in which Farsi is the predominant language, Rankin’s visually and narratively inventive film was inspired by Iranian films of the 1970s, frequently humanistic children’s fables, in this case transferred to a world of beige, concrete brutalist buildings and increasingly surreal, Tati-esque humor.

Directed by Matthew Rankin

2024 | Canada | Farsi and French language with English subtitles | DCP

Online sales end 15 minutes prior to showtime. Please visit the Harris Theater box office after this time to purchase tickets.

Lords Of The Sound Orchestra ""The Music of Hans Zimmer""

Lords of the Sound pays tribute to one of the most influential film composers of our era. Zimmer’s work has set the standard for modern film music, creating an atmosphere that transcends the screen and resonates with audiences globally. This program features scores from Zimmer’s vast repertoire, including Dune, The Dark Knight, Inception, Pirates of the Caribbean, Interstellar, Sherlock Holmes, The Lion King, Man of Steel, and more. Through a mix of classical and rock elements, this concert delivers an exhilarating journey into Zimmer's universe, where rich soundscapes and the positive energy of every orchestra member, vocalist, and conductor on stage surround audiences.

The concert promises a well-balanced showcase of Zimmer’s most beloved music, capturing the essence of modern cinema with every note. With Nazar Yakobenchuk as conductor and soloists Illia Skrebnov and Yaroslava Taran, Lords of the Sound ensures a performance that is as moving as it is memorable, bringing the cinematic magic of Zimmer’s scores to life.

This is a rental event presented by an independent organization separate from the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The Trust is committed to its core values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, including freedom of expression.

MARRIAGE ON THE ROCKS SERVED UP WITH A TONY AWARD
It’s all fun and games until the one and only Edward Albee picks up his pen. His 1962 masterpiece WHO’S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? is a caustic cocktail of razor-sharp dialogue and electrifying performances that has kept audiences coming back for another round for decades. After a university faculty party, disillusioned professor George and his domineering wife Martha invite an unsuspecting younger couple, Nick and Honey, over for drinks. The evening devolves into a series of comedically cruel mind games and bitter confrontations, revealing deep-seated resentments and hidden truths about both couples. Buckle up for a night of explosive drama and dark humor in this dazzling theatrical powerhouse.

This play is Rated MA and is for mature audiences only. Due to adult content, themes, and language, this show is not recommended for children. This show contains violence and abuse, sexual content, explicit language, use of alcohol, and the use of prop guns on stage.

A household name for his 2x Golden Globe and 3x Emmy Award-winning performance playing the fast-talking, acerbic Hollywood agent ‘Ari Gold’ in the HBO series Entourage, actor, comedian, and podcast host Jeremy Piven also achieved significant success playing the title role in the British/PBS television drama series Mr Selfridge , the semi-fictional story based on the life of Harry Selfridge, who founded the London department store Selfridge's. Piven has also appeared in numerous successful films, including Grosse Pointe Blank, Singles, Very Bad Things, The Family Man, Black Hawk Down, The Kingdom, Heat, PC, Old School, Rock N Rolla, Serendipity, Smokin' Aces, and Runaway Jury.

Piven appears as Joel Lapchick the man responsible for helping Nat “Sweetwater” Clifton break the color barrier in the NBA in 1950 in the movie Sweetwater, which dropped on Angel Studios on September 26th, soon to be available VOD. His next film, The Performance, is an adaptation of an Arthur Miller work due out in theaters at the end of 2024.

He was recently seen in the feature film Last Call opposite Oscar winner Bruce Dern and Orange is the New Black star Taryn Manning. Other recent and upcoming films include American Night opposite Oscar nominee Emile Hirsch, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, which screened at the Venice Film Festival, period drama film The Walk opposite Justin Chatwin and Oscar nominee Terrence Howard, and The System which teamed him up again with Terrence Howard and Tyrese Gibson.

Piven also released the popular podcast “How U Livin’ J Piven,'' where he interviewed influential guests such as Jamie Foxx, Tiffany Haddish, Common, Mark Cuban and UFC stars Rashad Evans and Jorge Masvidal, in an intimate and in-depth format that showcased his dynamic personality in a never-before-seen way. The show is available wherever you get your podcasts.

Piven now tours the country with his successful stand-up comedy show, flexing a comedic muscle that few actors have been able to transition over to. The tour will see him across the entire continental U.S. and also take him internationally to the U.K. and beyond.

This is a rental event presented by an independent organization separate from the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The Trust is committed to its core values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, including freedom of expression.

Music by Giacomo Puccini
Libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa

His escape is her cage.

In this groundbreaking new production created by an all-Japanese and Japanese American creative team, Madama Butterfly’s story is transported to a fantastical realm where reality and dreams intersect.

Pinkerton puts on a VR headset and transports us into a vibrant virtual reality playground where he has ultimate control. As his avatar, a U.S. Navy Lieutenant, he can seduce and marry his fantasy girl and abandon her just as easily. But to Cio-Cio San, this is no game and the love and betrayal she feels is all too real.

Enveloped in Puccini’s stunning music, this visually beautiful production is the perfect match. Pittsburgh Opera is proud to partner with Cincinnati Opera, Detroit Opera, and Utah Opera to co-produce this reinvention of Puccini’s classic, uncovering new and resonant meaning for all audiences to enjoy.

Live Music
“…a perfectly combustible electric-acoustic outfit whose smart, often challenging and unpredictable compositions draw from fusion, postbop and contemporary jazz.” — Jazz Times

Throughout their storied 43-year history, the Yellowjackets have recorded 26 albums, received 16 Grammy® nominations – won 2 – performed countless sold-out tours, and enjoyed worldwide critical acclaim and commercial success.
The Yellowjackets formed in the late 1970’s as the backup band for guitarist Robben Ford. They recorded their first album together in 1980. Shortly after that recording, however, Ford decided to part ways and go in a different musical direction. As a result, the modern day Yellowjackets were formed — a trio with Russell Ferrante, Jimmy Haslip and Ricky Lawson. Since then, and with the addition of Bob Mintzer, the Yellowjackets have gained and maintained prominence as one of jazz’s most influential and loved groups.

Over the years the band has undergone numerous lineup changes. Never failing to rise to the inevitable challenges of adjustment, the Yellowjackets - Russell Ferrante, William Kennedy, Bob Mintzer - have maintained an extraordinarily high quality of musicianship that is the rival of many but a surprise to no one who knows and appreciates the band and their music.
The most recent addition to the band adds Australian bass player Dane Alderson into the mix. With his exceptional rhythmic sensibility and natural disposition toward groove, Dane brings a new energy to the band and adds a youthful approach to the music.
The Yellowjackets album “Raising Our Voice"" was released in Fall 2018 and features special guest vocalist Luciana Souza. Their album ""Jackets XL with the WDR Big Band"" was nominated for a Grammy® in 2021.

Their latest album ""Parallel Motion"" (2022) also received a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Instrumental Album and is a true testament to the longevity and resilience of a band who debuted over 40 years ago. Consistently reinventing themselves through elevated instrumentation in their signature electro-acoustic soundscape, the current lineup showcases a collective at their prime.

BEETHOVEN: Symphony No. 6, ""Pastoral""

About this Performance
The PSO’s season features works inspired by the natural world: Beethoven’s “Pastoral” you can hear bucolic bird calls, the rolling of thunder, and the calling of a shepherd’s pipes from distant hills. Habibi’s new work was written as a meditation on climate change. Eisendle’s Heliosis, from the Greek word for the sun, is in turn blistering, scorching, and shimmering.

TICKET LIMIT: 8 per customer

Alabama-bred and Nashville-based, comedian, actress, and content creator, Danae Hays represents a fresh, new female voice in the comedy, acting, and music worlds. Her cast of zany southern characters and parody country music songs have pushed her to the top of the Spotify and Apple Music charts, earning her a cumulative following of 3.6M+ followers and nearly 2 billion views.

Danae's debut Country/Comedy single ""Rode Hard"" peaked at No. 5 on the Country Global iTunes Charts, No. 8 on Billboard’s Country Digital Song Sales, No. 22 on Billboard’s Digital Song Sales, and No. 34 on Billboard’s Emerging Artists.

Earlier this year, Danae wrapped her debut comedy tour, which sold out in minutes. The tour has been extended through the end of the year and transitioned theaters. Danae and her wife, Mandie Kaii, host the weekly podcast called The Refined and Rowdy Show, where humor, heart and contrasting perspectives collide as they discuss everything from pop culture to heated issues. The podcast — which launched in Fall 2023 — just recently surpassed 1 million listeners.

True to her multi-hyphenate nature, Danae's passion for acting landed her a role in ""Mother Nature and the Doomsday Prepper"" (which she just returned from filming in the spring of 2024) and ""Summer Camp"". Additionally, Danae has co-and-guest starred alongside many of the most notable names in entertainment including Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard, Tanya Christiansen and Josh Peck.

This is a rental event presented by an independent organization separate from the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The Trust is committed to its core values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, including freedom of expression.

International icon and multi-hyphenate musician, actor, playwright and performer, Storm Large has affixed herself as the queen of twisted beauty & subversive delights to a cult-like following of millions across the page, stage & screen.

Following a stratospheric rise from the Portland club scene to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and sold-out runs at the Kennedy Center, Large’s endeavors both as a soloist and with her bands – The Balls and Pink Martini, then Le Bonheur – have installed her as a quintessential cabaret powerhouse through renditions of the American Songbook, a one-women musical memoir in Crazy Enough, features on CBS’ Rock Star: Supernova & America’s Got Talent, homages to the work of Randy Newman, and beyond.

She’s a tour de force that’s shared the stage with the likes of Joel Grey, Liza Minnelli and Michael Feinstein. Now, she brings her stellar talents to the state-of-the-art Greer Cabaret Theater for one night only!

The office, Creative Philadelphia, in its own words, “offers opportunities for all Philadelphians to thrive through the arts. The office aims to increase public access to arts and culture, partner with local creative communities, and highlight the city’s cultural assets.” In the past eight years the office has provided almost $6 million in funding to 7,688 Philadelphia-based individual artists and arts organizations. This funding provided cultural programs in communities, pay for artists and arts organizations to compete in City’s public art commissions, and grant funding for individual artists and small arts organizations. 

Join us for a conversation on the future of fueling local creative economies, and supporting a healthier thriving community.

Liberty Magic
SKELETON KEY VIP 
A magic show from the life & imagination of Malin Nilsson.

“Malin” is not short for “Malini.” Max Malini was a famous magician who lived about 100 years ago, and “Malin” is short for Magical Alternative Lavishly Ignoring the Norm.

The carport was her curtain, the garage her theatre and the imaginary audience was sitting on garden furniture. The props came from the kitchen, and she would perform for hours pretending to be Max Malini. She would begin “Dear friends, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called life.” However, Malin is not Malini, and the audience is not imaginary any longer, but the props do still come from the kitchen.

Magic: Unplugged is a laugh-out-loud, theatrical, quirky one-person magic show that comes straight from the heart to the stage. A life of magic packed into 70 minutes. Handmade magic tricks, surrealism, and comedy, topped with raw onions and a pinch of confetti. It’s a show that will go down in history, just like everything else, that’s how history works.

“The standout vibraphonist of his generation.”
— The New Yorker

“His music needs no labels like ‘postmodern’ or ‘cutting edge’. It is Stefon Harris music, as Charles Mingus, he insisted, was Mingus music.”
— Nat Hentoff, Jazz Times Magazine

Stefon Harris’ passionate artistry and astonishing virtuosity have propelled him to the forefront of the jazz scene. In 2020 on National Public Radio (NPR), Harris' feature highlighted his contributions as a musician but also as an educator and thought leader who teaches empathy from the bandstand. Harris has also been featured as one of the leading and emerging artists for Apollo’s New Works Master Artist residency. In 2019, Hot House and Jazz Mobile awarded Harris best vibes as part of the best and brightest for the New York Readers Jazz awards. Heralded as “one of the most important artists in jazz” (Los Angeles Times), he is a recipient of the prestigious 2018 Doris Duke Artist Award, the Martin E. Segal Award from Lincoln Center, has earned four GRAMMYTM nominations, and has been named Best Mallet player eight times by the Jazz Journalist Association. He was also chosen Best Vibes in the 2018 and 2017 Downbeat Magazine Critic’s Poll, the 2016 Jazz Times Expanded Critics Poll, the 2014 Jazz Times Critics Poll and the 2013 Downbeat Critics Poll. NPR’s All Things Considered praised Mr. Harris’ audacious CD Urbanus, which also earned a GRAMMY TM nomination for Best Contemporary Jazz Album, as one of “The Year’s Best New Jazz” recordings. As a member of the SFJAZZ Collective, their 2014 CD, Wonder: The Songs of Stevie Wonder, won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Jazz Album.

PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh

Broadway & Musical Theater
Get ready for a “glorious, toe-tapping, razzle-dazzling "" (Deadline) time with Some Like It Hot, the hit Tony and Grammy Award-winning Broadway musical. Set in Prohibition era, this fast-paced comedy follows two musicians who take up new identities and go on the run after witnessing a mob hit.

Their cross-country journey brings them face to face with a dazzling singer with dreams of stardom, who captures one of their hearts, while the other catches the eye of a wealthy suitor set on finding true love. Still under disguise, they must find a way to untangle their messes and stay alive from the gangsters hot on their tail!

With a book by Tony-winner Matthew López (The Inheritance) and Amber Ruffin, vibrant musical score crafted by the Hairspray team of Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, and Tony-winning choreography from director Casey Nicholaw (The Book of Mormon, Mean Girls, Aladdin), Some Like It Hot is a fresh adaptation that is “a super-sized all out song-and-dance spectacular” (The New York Times)

Whatever you do, don't let the Pigeon star in his own musical production! With a script written by Mo Willems, the creator of the #1 New York Times best-selling, Caldecott Honor award-winning ""Pigeon"" picture books, and featuring music by Deborah Wicks La Puma (Elephant & Piggie's We Are in a Play!), TheaterWorksUSA‘s Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus! The Musical! is even more fun than staying up late and having a hot dog party!

It's not easy being the Pigeon-you never get to do ANYTHING! But when the Bus Driver has a crisis that threatens to make her passengers (gasp!) late, maybe that wily bird CAN do something. Featuring an innovative mix of songs, and feathers, Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus! The Musical! is sure to get everyone's wings flapping.

Preshow fun! Children attending this performance are invited to participate in an arts/craft activity before the show. Created by Trust teaching artists, the activity is age appropriate for the show, and is intended to teach, engage, and entertain young theater goers. Families also receive a book or other giveaway, while supplies last. Activities take place in the Byham lobby, beginning one hour before the start of the show. Sponsored by PNC Grow Up Great and The Grable Foundation.

Pittsburgh Opera

Opera
Music by Jennifer Higdon
Libretto by Jerre Dye

A family portrait

When Mona finds a mysterious suitcase filled with stolen masterpieces, she must grapple with a choice to save these priceless paintings or save her son—the thief. Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son’s crime, but one of the paintings—Lucien Freud’s “Woman With Eyes Closed”—looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was still young. The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings.

This world premiere opera from award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon (Cold Mountain) is inspired by a real-life art heist, and confronts the question “what is the true value of a work of art?” This is an opera that needs to be seen at least twice; each night of the production has the possibility of a completely new ending!

Commissioned by Opera Philadelphia. Funded in part by The Amphion Foundation, Inc.

Performance takes place at The Bitz Opera Factory (Pittsburgh Opera's headquarters), 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh's Strip District.

Saturday, April 26, 2025  * 8:00 PM- ~9:15 PM (approx. end time) Ending One

Pittsburgh Regional Premiere

A musical baked from the heart!

Jenna, a waitress and expert pie maker, is stuck in a small town and a loveless marriage. Faced with an unexpected pregnancy, Jenna fears she may have to abandon the dream of opening her own pie shop…until a baking contest in a nearby county and the town's handsome new doctor offer her a tempting recipe for happiness. Supported by her quirky crew of fellow waitresses and loyal customers, Jenna summons the secret ingredient she's been missing all along — courage.

Featuring the memorable and moving songs, “She Used To Be Mine,” “What Baking Can Do,” and “It Only Takes A Taste.” Waitress is inspired by Adrienne Shelly's beloved film and offers a special recipe for finding happiness in unexpected places. The musical celebrates the power of friendship, dreams, family, and the beauty of a well-baked pie.

Book by Jessie Nelson
Music and Lyrics by Sara Bareilles

WAITRESS is presented through special arrangement with Music Theatre International (MTI). All authorized performance materials are also supplied by MTI. www.mtishows.com

Most recently, Halkias wrote, produced, and starred in the indie comedy “Let's Start a Cult”. His latest special ""Fat Rascal"" is available on Netflix. His debut special, “Live at the Lodge Room” reached a million views in its first four days and currently sits at over 7M million views. Last year, he was named to Vulture’s 2023 list of “Comedians You Should and Will Know,” and identified by GQ as “at the front of a new wave of comedians.”

His podcast “Stavvy’s World” debuted at #3 on the iTunes comedy charts and garnered hundreds of thousands of subscribers in its first year. He’s a former co-host and founding member of the popular podcast “Cum Town,” which ran from 2016-2022 and he was recently featured in Steven Soderbergh’s sci-fi series “Command Z.” Halkias is also an accomplished model, walking in Kid Super’s Paris fashion week show in 2023 where he was described by Vogue as “the plus-est of plus size models”.

Live Music
Founded by pianist and composer Renee Rosnes, ARTEMIS is a powerful ensemble of instrumental virtuosos. Along with Rosnes, the quintet consists of trumpeter Ingrid Jensen, saxophonist Nicole Glover, bassist Noriko Ueda and drummer Allison Miller.

After experiencing an ARTEMIS live show at the 2018 Newport Jazz Festival, Blue Note Records President, Don Was, signed the band to the label. Their third recording “Arboresque” will be released February 28, 2025. The album is testament to the group’s evolving musical landscape featuring stellar arrangements and riveting originals contributed by all members of the band.

Performances across North America and Europe at major venues and festivals have garnered high praise from audiences and critics alike. NPR hailed the band as “a killer line-up of players, composers and performers…who converge on an extremely cosmopolitan, sleek, rhythm-forward, modern sound.” It is no wonder that ARTEMIS has been awarded #1 Group of the Year in the Annual Downbeat Readers Poll in both 2023 and 2024.

KHACHATURIAN: Violin Concerto 
BRAHMS: Symphony No. 4 

About this Performance
Brahms' fourth and last symphony has been called ""one of the supreme creative acts of the Romantic era"" and is fraught with tension between lyrical beauty, intense drama, and subdued melancholy. The violin concerto by Armenian composer Aram Khachaturian, remarkable for its high-flying virtuosity, its yearning melodic intensity, its exoticism, is an under-performed gem in the music repertoire.

Kimberly Richards returns as Sister!


It’s up to Sister to save the souls of those assembled – aka the audience! Beginning with an overview of heaven and hell as a Catholic version of Chutes and Ladders and moving onto her proclamation of new sins for the new millennium, Sister is never hesitant to tell us where we’ve gone wrong. (Needless to say, excessive tattooing and piercing are right up there with pornographic websites and dining at Hooters.) And never doubt that she can provide a list of every celebrity currently sharing digs with the devil. No one is excused from Sister’s firm belief that ‘sometimes we feel guilty because we are guilty.

In Late Bloomer, Sarah’s brand-new stand-up show, she explores how one became the other. Plus, lots of stuff about dinners and lady gardens. Come along and join Sarah on her second American tour, laugh at her, with her, beside her.

Pittsburgh CLO
Benedum Center
Broadway & Musical Theater
Journey to a mystical realm where thrones are won through power, love, and betrayal — and swords decide the fate of kings — a kingdom's destiny hangs in the balance. Lerner and Loewe’s timeless musical masterpiece plunges us into the legendary love triangle between King Arthur, Queen Guenevere, and the valiant Sir Lancelot. Their passions and loyalties will shape the rise and fall of Arthur's realm. Yet, as with all great legends, the dream of Lerner & Loewe's​ CAMELOT may come at a cost — as the quest for love and honor clashes with the pursuit of power. Revered as a legendary triumph on Broadway, this epic tale of knights and royalty has captivated audiences of all generations. The show’s haunting ballads and stirring anthems, including “If Ever I Would Leave You,” “I Loved You Once in Silence,” and “The Lusty Month of May,” echo across the ages proving why legends endure and speak to us today.

At the latest count he has taken tour shows to over forty different countries and his last world tour, Terribly Funny, sold over 1.2 million tickets globally. Jimmy Carr: Laughs Funny will extend his reach even further and marks the first time this record-breaking comedian has toured in arenas in the UK and Ireland.

Jimmy is a household name in UK television, well known for hosting Channel 4’s 8 Out Of 10 Cats, 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown and Big Fat Quiz Of The Year in addition to presenting Comedy Central’s Roast Battle UK and Your Face Or Mine.

He also presented and exec-produced an original panel show format for Netflix, The Fix, and has been a guest multiple times on US staples such The Tonight Show, The Late, Late Show and Late Night With Conan O’Brien. He has performed at the Montreal Just For Laughs Comedy Festival since 2003 with more appearances than any other UK act in that time. 

Before making the move to streaming, Jimmy was one of the bestselling acts in the comedy DVD market, his eight titles (Live, Stand-Up, Comedian, In Concert, Telling Jokes, Making People Laugh, Being Funny and Laughing & Joking) selling over 1.2 million copies between them. These shows are now all available on Jimmy’s YouTube channel, where he has accrued over 1.1 million subscribers and 436 million views since launching in 2018.

SHAKESPEARE SINGS AND LOVE WINS
If musicals be the food of love, let this groundbreaking adaptation of Shakespeare’s most cherished comedy play on! When noblewoman Viola finds herself shipwrecked, she decides to disguise herself as the male page Cesario to blend in. Her decision triggers literature’s most hilarious love triangle and inspires the people of Illyria to see life through the eyes of another. This production not only enchants with its catchy pop score but also introduces Pittsburgh to the transformative Public Works program. Through community collaboration, this theatrical marvel becomes a celebration that is truly for, by, and of the people. Revel in the magic of love, laughter, and fellowship in this unmissable spectacle.

Rated PG for mild swearing, crude humor, suggestive dialogue, violence, alcohol use, and themes of death and grief.

Public Works is made possible through the generous support of the Richard King Mellon Foundation.

About the Concert
Join your Pittsburgh Symphony in a new Marvel Studios film concert that will take you on an epic on-screen cinematic journey that covers twenty-three films in one momentous concert experience.

Then recapture the excitement as Earth’s mightiest heroes join forces for the first time and open the door to the next wave of Avengers: Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel, and more. The Guardians of the Galaxy don’t miss this party either, dropping in to deliver a taste of their iconic mixtape backed by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Finally, the spectacle culminates in a revisiting of the ultimate trials of the Infinity Saga. It’s time for fans – new and old – to assemble and relive every iconic moment from this defining canon of films, all accompanied by live orchestra, fireworks, surprises, and a crowd of thousands.

LME and Steve Litman Presents
Benedum Center
Comedy
Tickets for this event are scheduled to go on sale on Fri, Mar 7, 2025, 10:00 AM.
TICKET LIMIT: 6 per customer

Steve Martin and Martin Short’s “The Dukes of Funnytown!” is a show that redefines the form in unexpected and profound ways, from two of the funniest, most influential and acclaimed talents of the past century. Their humor is often subversive, but it is always a joyous self-deprecating romp from two comedy masters driven to make each other laugh as much as the audience. The jokes come at you at a rapid-fire pace with little set-up and big punch lines as they mock Hollywood and the fickle nature of celebrity, but the comedy truly soars when they lovingly (and relentlessly) roast each other.

Martin and Short’s chemistry and timing on stage reflects a friendship forged over three decades which developed when they met for the first time on the set of the 1986 film “Three Amigos.” These two titans of comedy have been touring together since 2015, when they launched their first live show entitled “A Very Stupid Conversation.”

This is a rental event presented by an independent organization separate from the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The Trust is committed to its core values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, including freedom of expression.

Relaxed atmosphere | Shorter concerts | On-stage host | Signature cocktails

“I invite all our subscribers to experience Disrupt. The fantastic artists of the orchestra explore the emotion and story of the music and composers in new ways. It truly is a fascinating musical experience."" Manfred Honeck

The Stories We Keep

The Stories We Keep: Conserving Objects from Ancient Egypt
Open through Summer 2025

Every Egyptian object in the museum’s care has stories to tell, about its creation and original use, its journey to Pittsburgh, and about the lives of those in ancient Egypt. The Stories We Keep features more than 80 ancient items—including the 4,000-year-old Dahshur boat, one of only four in the world. Engage with these objects like never before, have conversations with museum conservators, observe the care and restoration of objects in real time, and attempt the work yourself by reassembling replicas of ancient artifacts.

The Stories We Keep invites visitors to see these objects—cared for by the Museum for more than a century—in a new light and to witness the work that will preserve them for future generations.

Learn more about conservation of ancient Egyptian artifacts.

Gertrude Abercrombie, Where or When (Things Past), 1948, Collection of the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, Wisconsin, Gift of the Gertrude Abercrombie Trust
Gertrude Abercrombie (American, 1909–1977) was a critical figure in the mid-20th-century Chicago art scene and a creative force who, from the 1930s until her death in 1977, produced enigmatic paintings populated with objects and figures of personal significance. With a deft hand, a concise symbolic vocabulary, and a restrained palette, she created potent images that speak to her mercurial nature and her evolving psychology as an artist. Cats, owls, snails, doors, moons, barren trees, seashells, forking paths, and masked figures all converge in her mysterious works, which suggest a life of wistful introspection and emotional struggle. Drawing consistently on her own dreams as source material, Abercrombie said, “The whole world is a mystery.”

This exhibition presents a rare opportunity for museum visitors to appreciate—in significant depth—Abercrombie’s highly personal language that draws on surrealist and magic realism approaches to probe deeply into the nature of things. Featuring loans from important institutional and private collections, Gertrude Abercrombie: The Whole World Is a Mystery is the most comprehensive museum presentation of the artist’s work to date.

A testament to how strong the curation is at Carnegie Museum of Art, a world-class institution that constantly proves why it bears that label. Pittsburgh Magazine
Gertrude Abercrombie: The Whole World Is a Mystery is co-organized by Carnegie Museum of Art and Colby College Museum of Art, and is curated by Eric Crosby, Henry J. Heinz II Director, Carnegie Museum of Art, and Vice President, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, and Sarah Humphreville, Lunder Curator of American Art, Colby College Museum of Art, with Cynthia Stucki, curatorial assistant, Carnegie Museum of Art. The exhibition will be on view at Colby College Museum of Art from July 12, 2025 through Jan. 11, 2026.

About the Artist
Gertrude Abercrombie was born in 1909 in Austin, Texas. She grew up in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago but also spent significant time in her father’s hometown of Aledo, Illinois, which would later become a source of inspiration for her paintings. She earned a degree in Romance languages at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in 1929, after which she pursued a year-long course in commercial art at the American Academy of Art and may also have briefly attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

In 1932, Abercrombie began her career as a professional artist, an ambition that was forwarded when she gained employment on the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA/FAP) from 1935–1940. She showed her work widely, including in the Art Institute of Chicago’s annual exhibitions and at avant-garde venues like the Katharine Kuh Gallery. By the late 1930s, Abercrombie had developed her mature style, creating tightly executed paintings populated by personal symbols that pulse with mystery and which have been identified with surrealism, magic realism, and the fantastic. She worked in this vein for the remainder of her career, but her output gradually decreased toward the end of her life due to ongoing health struggles. Abercrombie was also well known as the host of parties and jam sessions, which were attended by her artist, writer, and jazz musician friends.

Join artist educators for Dandy Andy, a monthly tour that focuses on Warhol’s queer history. While his sexuality is frequently suppressed or debated, Warhol was a gay man who had several partners throughout his life. Warhol’s boyfriends, including Edward Wallowitch, John Giorno, and Jed Johnson, were also his colleagues and collaborators, helping to shape and define his career as an artist. This tour traces Warhol’s romantic relationships and queer identity against the backdrop of the historical gay rights movement in the United States. Tours meet on the museum’s seventh floor.

Where do we find rest? How do we share our meals? Can the spaces we inhabit daily help us better nurture one another? How might the design of a living room or a kitchen relate to—and empower—a broader sense of community?

For Tatiana Bilbao (born 1972) and her Mexico City practice Tatiana Bilbao Estudio, architecture results from research that includes exploratory exhibitions. In this exhibition, five of the galleries are assigned an individual room typology—kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, living room, and garden. The architects associate each room type with current projects, revealing, for instance, the role of communal kitchens in a residential building in Mexico City or the way small gardens coexist with houses in St. Louis, MO. These relationships offer new possibilities for privacy and publicness.

City of Rooms communicates an approach to architecture filled with incident and capable of change across time. Tatiana Bilbao Estudio’s vision, research, and experimental practice welcome us into an interdependent, vital, and mutually supportive urban fabric, a proverbial city of rooms.

Tatiana Bilbao Estudio: City of Rooms is organized by Raymund Ryan, curator-at-large, Heinz Architectural Center.

Gala Porras-Kim: The reflection at the threshold of a categorical division

Forum 90
Systems of categorization and inevitable mislabeling, material preservation and eventual degradation, and an impulse to record in the face of inherent forgetfulness—these contradictions inform Gala Porras-Kim’s (b. 1984, Bogotá, Colombia) interest in museums and their practices. In dialogue with curators at Carnegie Museum of Art over the past two years, Porras-Kim has been trawling the museum’s database to better understand its holdings and the Carnegie Institute’s evolving cataloguing systems and acquisition history. Her findings reveal overlapping areas in the collections of Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and Carnegie Public Library, where each institution stewards their objects differently—as art, science, and information respectively. Porras-Kim proposes that art is not a fixed category, and questions the conceptual frameworks and individual subjectivities that go into presenting and understanding an object as a work of art.

Gala Porras-Kim is organized by Liz Park, Richard Armstrong Curator of Contemporary Art, and Cynthia Stucki, curatorial assistant.

Part of → Forum Series

Forum Series
Forum Gallery presents the work of living artists in an ongoing series that invites them to expand their practice through a commission or new presentation of existing works. Initiated in 1990, and with 86 projects to date, the Forum series is an opportunity for artists to deepen their relationship to and understanding of the museum.

Raymond Saunders: Flowers from a Black Garden
Heinz Galleries Mar. 22–July 13, 2025
Raymond Saunders: Flowers from a Black Garden is the artist’s first solo museum exhibition since 1996 and the most in-depth consideration of his practice to date.

Since the 1960s, artist Raymond Saunders (b. 1934) has developed a painting practice rooted in improvisation. Working across mediums, he combines everyday objects, found imagery, drawing, notational markings, and text in constellated compositions that blend abstraction and figuration against the complex backdrop of American history.

Saunders was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA, where he participated in Carnegie Museum of Art’s still ongoing Saturday art classes for young people. His mentor, Joseph C. Fitzpatrick, the instructor of the museums’ Saturday art classes and the director of art for Pittsburgh public schools, also taught Andy Warhol, Philip Pearlstein, and Mel Bochner. He obtained a scholarship to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and went on to earn a BFA from Carnegie Institute of Technology (1960). He then moved to Oakland, CA, where he continues to live and work. He received an MFA from the California College of Arts and Crafts (1961) and later served there and at California State University East Bay as a faculty member.

In his large-scale works, Saunders routinely deploys a black ground recalling a literal blackboard and the ideas explored in his 1967 essay Black Is a Color, in which he claims an expansive role for the Black artist. “i am not here to play the gallery,” Saunders writes. “i am not responsible for anyone’s entertainment. i am responsible for being as fully myself, as man and artist, as I possibly can be, while allowing myself to hope that in the effort some light, some love, some beauty may be shed upon the world, and perhaps some inequities put right.”

This exhibition moves freely across the artist’s career, taking as its point of departure Saunders’s position as a consummate student and passionate teacher of painting. Through some 35 works, including important institutional loans, it will investigate his multifaceted and nonlinear process of picture-making, which carries forward, in reference and reverence, myriad histories and languages of art. From Dada, expressionism, and assemblage to Fluxus, Pop, and postmodernism, Saunders’s charts an unexpected path through the medium of painting, as well as a romance with its poetic modes of communicating layers of consciousness.

Raymond Saunders: Flowers from a Black Garden is co-organized by Carnegie Museum of Art and Orange County Museum of Art. Carnegie Museum of Art’s presentation is curated by Eric Crosby, Henry J. Heinz II Director, Carnegie Museum of Art, and Vice President, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, with Alyssa Velazquez, assistant curator.

About the Artist
Raymond Saunders lives and works in Oakland, CA. He obtained his BFA from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, before moving to California, where he earned his MFA at the California College of Arts and Crafts. Saunders joined the faculty of California State University East Bay, Hayward, in 1968, eventually becoming an arts professor at California College of the Arts in Oakland. Saunders currently holds the title of professor emeritus from Cal State East Bay in Hayward. He was awarded a Rome Prize Fellowship in 1964, a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1976, and is a two-time recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts Awards (1977, 1984). His work was recently included in the traveling exhibition Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power, 1963–1983, organized by Tate Modern, London. He was also included in the traveling exhibition Now Dig This! Art and Black Los Angeles, 1960–1980, organized by the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles. Saunders works are included in the permanent collections of Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Howard University, Washington, DC; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Oakland Museum of California, Oakland; and Berkeley Art Museum in Berkeley, CA; among many others.

Fault Lines: Art, Imperialism, and the Atlantic World
Scaife Gallery 1 July 12, 2025–Jan. 25, 2026
Carnegie Museum of Art’s collection is known for its strength in 18th-century European art. This period is traditionally associated with the Enlightenment, and its intellectual and cultural changes leading to increased individual happiness and freedom. Fault Lines: Art, Imperialism, and the Atlantic World questions the biased coherence of this concept seen from Europe only, foregrounding instead the Atlantic world.

Seen from an Atlantic perspective, the world was geopolitically connected by competitive trade, endemic violence, war, and European increased colonial presence in Africa and the Americas. This exhibition brings together the work of artists who lived within the fluid imperial boundaries of Spanish, Dutch, French, and British Empires to explore the way that art and artists contributed to, reinforced, or undermined European imperial projects.

The exhibition is organized by Marie-Stéphanie Delamaire, curator of European and American art, with Emily Mirales, curatorial assistant.

Charles Harlan
Forum Gallery Aug. 22, 2025–Feb. 1, 2026
Forum 91
Water has been a recurring presence in the work of Charles Harlan (b. 1984, Smyrna, GA), whose meditative sculptures surface various materials and human histories. His readymade objects of choice, which are brought together with minimal alteration, are drawn from industrial, agricultural, and domestic aspects of our built environment. In their original non-art contexts, they have functional use value as components of machinery, manual labor, trade, craftsmanship, or conveyance. Through juxtaposition and assembly, they summon symbolic connotations from which surprising conversations about meaning-making start to emerge. Challenging some of our most basic assumptions about what sculpture can and should be, Harlan’s artworks offer an open field for our own cultural narratives and play of associations.

The exhibition is organized by Eric Crosby, Henry J. Heinz II Director, Carnegie Museum of Art, and Vice President, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.

In after school, architects, artists, designers, and educators come together to study the state of public education. They contend with institutional spaces, pedagogies, and legacies, and ask questions about representation, creativity, and care. How can a school be liberatory? From itinerant classrooms to cooperative educational experiments, the exhibition participants put forth propositions for a school unbound.

In dialogue with contemporary projects, the exhibition presents archival fragments of histories of public education in the region. The city’s schools have been a place where rights and futures have been imagined and fought for. Common infrastructures for education, curricular reforms, and contestations over the lines that demarcate school districts reveal a continuing process of learning and praxis towards a school that is not yet here. Drawing from regional archives and the museum’s collection, after school builds on these traces of learning spaces and curricular experiments which range from the New Deal programs of the 1930s to Street Academies and the struggles for desegregation and educational justice in the 1960s and 1970s.

after school is curated by Theodossis Issaias, curator at Heinz Architectural Center, and Alyssa Velazquez, assistant curator.

March 6, 2025
8:00 AM - 6:00 PM
Location
The Frick Pittsburgh
Cost:
Free and Open to All
Description:
Duquesne SoundWalk at the Frick is a new collaboration with students of Duquesne University’s Mary Pappert School of Music. The sounds of Frick past come to life through soundscapes, adding a new layer of dimensionality to the museum-going experience!

QR code exhibits, or SoundSites, are stationed throughout the Frick campus and allow visitors to interpret environment, culture, and history through sound. Recreations of the soundscapes surrounding Clayton in the 1890s, the home of a turn-of-the-century steelworker, the evolution of automobile horns, and the music enjoyed by the Frick family are just some of the sounds visitors can immerse themselves in throughout the site. Pick up a map in the Grable Visitor Center, or discover the stops as you wander the grounds. Use the camera on your smartphone to scan the codes and enjoy! If you don’t have a smart phone, stop by the Visitor Center to borrow one.

The SoundWalk project was recently awarded the 2023-24 John G. Rangos Sr. Prize, a university-wide prize given to innovative academic initiatives imagined by Duquesne University students and faculty members. SoundWalk led Dr. Nicole Vilkner, assistant professor of musicianship, and her students will continue to develop new SoundWalk projects in the future in new locations.

Our gardens and grounds, including the SoundWalk, are open 8 AM-Dusk, Tuesday through Sunday.

Description:
 

 
Comprised of 15 large-scale prints, Kara Walker: Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated) revisits the historical representations found in the two-volume anthology published in 1866, ""Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War."" Walker overlays enlargements of woodcut plates with her black silkscreen cutout figures in solid black silhouette. In doing so, Walker brings to light experiences of racism that were often omitted or merely hinted at in traditional historical narratives.

The touring presentation of Kara Walker: Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated) is organized by The Museum Box. The exhibition was curated by Lisa Hayes Williams, associate curator at the New Britain Museum of American Art where the show debuted in 2020.

Signature Clayton Tour Experience: Gilded, Not Golden
Tours run Tuesdays through Sundays
About the Tour
Just announced! Gilded, Not Golden, the newly reinterpreted tour of Clayton, won a 2024 Leadership in History Award from the American Association for State and Local History.

Look beneath the “gilded” surface of the late 19th century to reveal the era's more complicated truths. Discover Pittsburgh’s influence as an industrial powerhouse through a shared dialogue about the ongoing legacies of the Gilded Age.
 
""The tour guide did an excellent job of explaining the house details, decorative arts, family history & Gilded Age, in general. I particularly liked how history of the working class was woven in as a counterpoint to the lavish lifestyle of the wealthy.""

- Claire L.


The Gilded Age was an era not only of immense wealth and progress, but also rapid industrialization, unprecedented immigration, and labor strife. Explore this pivotal time in our nation’s history at Clayton, the only remaining fully preserved Gilded Age mansion in Pittsburgh. Join your guide and other visitors for a conversational experience that shares the stories of the Frick family and other Pittsburghers, and considers how the legacy of the Gilded Age continues to affect us today.
 

Content advisory: 1892 was a tumultuous year for the Frick family and the Pittsburgh steel industry. For this reason, tours of Clayton deal with potentially challenging subject matter, including discussions of violence, grief, and child loss.

About KEA
Raised in Pittsburgh to a singer/guitarist father and a violinist mother, KEA has had an intimate relationship with music all her life. With her love for literature, her first writings were in the realm of poetry. KEA's love for singing blossomed following vocal training from Elayne Kitay and the local Jazz Workshop. KEA was always sensitive and deeply affected by the ebb and flow of personal relationships — the sweet beginnings, the steamy evolutions, the work put in to sustain them, and all too often, the endings.

Her insights became poems and later songs, each helping her shape her unique outlet of soul with a touch of jazz. A debut single, ""iLove You,"" came to her one inspirational night in 2015 when she sat down to write a poem-like lullaby for one of her daughters. She later turned that poem into a song about an older daughter battling kidney hydro-nephrosis since birth. When the opportunity presented itself, KEA recorded ""iLove You"" and independently released it to the world on July 28, 2017, where it garnered profound international support on the BBC and Radiovolna and peaked at #1 on four U.K. Soul charts. smoothjazz.com even chose it as 'Song of the Month' by influential music site SoulTracks.

To keep up the momentum, KEA had a beautiful video shot in high definition 4K. From the pages of her life struggles, the storyline was the years that KEA placed romance on the backburner to focus on her daughter's health. The “iLove You” video was directed and edited by Deon Smalley (Smalley Films), and KEA, who also cast the clip and handled the production and costume design.

It was vital to KEA for the key locations around Pittsburgh to serve as backdrops, in-cluding Andrew Carnegie Free Library and Music Hall, Airbnb Historic Day House, and Dorsey’s Records shop. Most poignantly, the video starred KEA and her children Au-hneyah (6) and Alyssa (16) (playing one child over ten years), solidifying the intimate single-parent family portrait of unshakable love between a mother and daughter.

KEA returned with her second single. “Not My Friend,” a smooth, engaging groove with a pretty melody about a woman disconnecting from an unhealthy relationship. This song addressed a man who was verbally and emotionally abusive, controlling, non-communicative and self-centered. As a holiday treat for her increasing number of fans, KEA showcased her unique interpretive skills with a haunting rendition of Motown legend William “Smokey” Robinson’s winter of 1980 classic, “Being with You.” Where Robinson's rendition took a deceptively breezy musical approach about a man desper-ate to keep a lover, KEA dug into the darker psychological impact of the words.

KEA’s version of ""Being with You"" is known on the charts of America and the U.K. and she has achieved success on Digital Radio Tracker, Top 30 on the Urban Influencer urban chart, coveted streams on I-Heart radio, and supportive U.S. stations such as WFSK in Nashville, KCCB in Corning, Arkansas, and Top 10 status at Buffalo, New York's WUFO.

Promising more provocative songs with intriguing titles such as “Black Man,” “Black Beauty”, and “Pieces of a Man,” KEA’s goals are for mainstream and international suc-cess. She has performed at hometown Pittsburgh events and venues such as the Channel 11 News Holiday Parade, Stars at Riverview Jazz Series, The Birthright of Pittsburgh, the Explore East Liberty 2018 Wine Festival, the Harambe Black Arts Festi-val, the Christine Fréchard Gallery, and the Carnegie Arts Initiative (Jazz On 3rd).

The Black Lives Matter movement inspired ""Holla if You Hear Me” and it quickly be-came one of Amazon’s hottest new releases. KEA also achieved success on the UK Soul chart and the ‘National Indie Soul Chart’ platforms ranking in the top #30. She was even invited to perform for their BMMAC (Black Music Month Award Ceremony in Buffalo, New York. During the ceremony, she met Gary Hines, Music Director and Pro-ducer of the 3-time Grammy Award-Winning Sounds of Blackness. In the words of Gary Hines, he said about her performance, ""She killed tonight; she is amazing."" He told KEA, ""You are a phenomenal woman.""

Her success continued with “We made it thru” and “Turn it Around” — two releases that continued to show her ever-expanded range of lyric skills and ability to get to the heart of issues that really matter. But there is more to KEA than writing and recording. She is an artist who knows what it means to connect in-person with real people.

Always close to her community, she has been something of a staple in Pittsburgh's en-tertainment scene. The Downtown Pittsburgh Partnership and Walnut Capital and opening the Picklesburgh three-day festival held at the iconic Andy Warhol Bridge are all on her list of achievements. She even performed at “The Biggest Party of the Year”, Pittsburgh's Light Up Night festival.

KEA has been booked throughout the year and is always excited to connect with a new crowd with lyrics and sounds that are always raw, real, and straight from the heart.

About Kai Ballard
Kai is a trained drummer who mastered his craft while studying at Florissant Valley Community College followed by a stint at Indiana University School of Music, Bloomington, IN. It was at I.U. where his passion fully took hold and he played in a plethora of bands, operas, symphonies and musicals. Notable productions include Barber of Seville, Cabaret, Working, Meet Me In St. Louis and Phantom of the Opera.

He has also toured with Krystol who had a top ten billboard hit with “Passion for a Woman” writ-ten by Randy Jackson and opened for Morris Day, ConFunkShun and the Jetts. A year later and he toured with Hank Ballard and the Midnighters, followed by performances with Miki Howard and Jean Carne across a range of LA venues.

A notable career highlight was having the opportunity to rehearse with Stevie Wonder for sev-eral months in his Wonderland studio. Big things continued when Kai toured with L.L. Cool J on the Budweiser Tour alongside Whitney Houston, Keith Sweat, Digital Underground and many more. This was all before his passion for music took him to Japan with members of Earth, Wind & Fire, as well as several other groups of that era.

Jump forward to 1994 and you may remember seeing him perform on Saturday Night Live with the one and only Snoop Doggy Dogg. Hot off the back of that he received a full cymbal, stick and merchandise endorsement from Zildjian and continued to do his thing like no one else.

Along the way he took instruction at UCLA where Randy Jackson (then A&R VP at A&M Rec-ords) and Barry Squire (then A&R manager at Columbia Records) taught him like only they can. He soon headed over to Capitol Records where he would work on the iconic Paul McCartney’s “Back in the U.S.” tour in 2001.

Check in with Kai back in 2009 and you’ll have found him recording 8 tracks on Bone Thugs-N-Harmony’s “The World’s Enemy” CD. He was based in LA during this part of his career and worked on everything from heavy metal to country, before making the move to Pittsburgh 4 years ago.

Since arriving in the City of Bridges, Kai has played with Mike Sheer, Craig King, Eric Johnson (jazz), Tony Campbell, and others at Backstage Bar, Thunderbird, R Bar, and James Street. You’ll find him teaching drumming at Nstuff Music where he continues to share his passion with the next generation.

Description:
Join Kahren Jones Arbitman, Ph.D., for this one-hour lecture, which will explore the long evolution of the artistic depiction of Christ on the cross, while taking a closer look at some of western art's greatest masterpieces.
The Art of the Crucifixion: From Anguish to Absurdity
Depictions of the crucified Christ are common in both churches and art museums, though the specifics can vary widely. The Bible gives scant details and leaves a lot of room for imagination, and artists of every era have been quick to add their own creative touches. From Byzantine works that adhered closely to theological doctrine, to Western wealthy patrons with their own ideas about how the crucifixion should be shown, to modern artists creating passionate testaments to their personal beliefs as well as their views on politics and social justice, there is much to examine through visual representations of this singular, profound event.

a renaissance painting by Arcangelo Cola da Camerino that depicts the madonna and the crucifixion of christ
Arcangelo Cola da Camerino, Italian, The Madonna and Child, Enthroned; Crucifixion, circa 1420-1422, tempera on panel, 20 x 23 1/4 in. Frick Art & Historical Center.

 

Dr. Arbitman received both an MA and Ph.D. in art history from the University of Pittsburgh with a specialization in seventeenth-century Dutch art, more specifically, Rembrandt. After serving as the first curator-in-charge of The Frick Art Museum in 1985, she went on to become the director of the Palmer Museum of Art at Penn State University and the Executive Director of the Cummer Museum of Art & Gardens in Florida.

April 24, 2025
7:00 PM - 8:00 PM
Location
The Frick Art Museum Auditorium
Cost:
Members of The Frick Societies receive complimentary admission

$25 members; $35 non-members; $15 students
Description:
Join Dr. Edda Fields-Black for an examination of untold stories and reclaimed histories through her most recent book, COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid and Black Freedom during the Civil War. COMBEE explores Harriet Tubman’s often-overlooked role in the largest slave rebellion in US history that resulted in the liberation of 756 people from bondage on seven rice plantations. Through previously unexamined sources, Dr. Fields-Black—herself a descendent of a soldier who fought in the raid—brings to life the Combahee River Raid and the untold stories of those freed, their resilience, and the lasting impact of Tubman’s heroism.

 
Following the book talk, enjoy a light reception and book signing with the author as well as access to Kara Walker: Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated). Ticket price includes exhibition admission, advanced registration required.

 
Dr. Edda L. Fields-Black is a Professor in the Department of History and the Director of the Dietrich College Humanities Center at Carnegie Mellon University.

Gherkin Games
This year, dare dill-vils from across the land competed for a shot at gherkin glory in three heart pounding events
Preliminary heats took take place on Friday, July 19 and Saturday, July 20, culminating in championships on Sunday, July 21. The winning champion of each event relished their victory with $500 in grand prize money, a life-like pickle trophy, and—most importantly—a “royal” title fitting of their pickle prowess.

Congrats to our 2024 Champions!

Pickle Juice Drinking
Quench your thirst for brine in this test of speed and fermented fortitude. Whoever can chug a quart (32 fl oz.) of Pittsburgh Pickle Company’s Picklexir the fastest will be deemed the winner of their round and vie for the title of Duke of Drinking in the championship on Sunday.


Pickle Eating – New!
Only stomachs of steel will prevail in this new contest category! Whoever eats the most pickles by weight in five minutes (‘chipmunking’ is allowed) will win their round and earn a spot in the final, where the Earl of Eating, first of their name, will be crowned.

Bobbing for Pickles – New!
No hands are allowed in this pickled take on the peculiar party pastime. Whoever can retrieve the most pickles by weight in 90 seconds using only their mouth will win the round and face-off in the finals to become Picklesburgh’s first Baron of Bobbing!


General Contest Rules & Regulations
All contestants must be 18 years of age or older.
All contestants will initially be selected through the pre-registration process.
Contestants may complete only one registration form per event – duplicate entries in the same event will not be counted.
All contestants must complete a waiver of liability and publicity release on-site the day of the contest.
Contestants may only compete in one preliminary round of each game.
Contestants will receive an email confirming their assigned round time and further details.
Assigned competition slots are non-transferrable. If you can no longer participate, please let us know.
There will be preliminary rounds held each day of the event and a final championship round held on the final day of the event. The winners of each preliminary round will be required to return to the festival to compete in the championship round on Sunday, July 21.
Contestants must arrive at the assigned check-in area (included in their acceptance email) no later than 30 minutes prior to their assigned competition round or they forfeit their time slot.
Any forfeited/open slots will be randomly assigned to on-site walk-ups, which are open to any eligible adult.

Iconic Hometown Favorites Get Exclusive Picklesburgh Twist

Voted #1 Food Festival in America for the three consecutive years, Picklesburgh provides a perfect opportunity for Pittsburgh’s most beloved local food and drink purveyors to surprise and dill-ight festival goers with pickled twists on familiar favorites. This year’s festival expands to four days (July 18 – 21) with an exclusive menu of hometown crowd pleasers from some of Pittsburgh’s most iconic and beloved breweries, bakeries and eateries including Iron Born Pizza, Hyeholde, Fl.2, Meat & Potatoes, Millie’s Ice Cream, DiAnoia’s Eatery, Yuzu and Burgatory.

NEW! Introducing IC Pickle!
A Steel City staple, Iron City Beer is thrilled to debut its newest concoction: IC Pickle! A fermented first for Picklesburgh, this exclusive pickle-flavored edition of Iron City’s popular IC Light beer was developed in collaboration with Pittsburgh Pickle Company. “The crisp taste of cucumber balanced with fresh dill makes this lager most refreshing when spending the day trying the best pickles Pittsburgh has to offer,” said Brandon Mayes, director of brewing and quality assurance. IC Pickle will be exclusively on tap at Picklesburgh and is sure to be a hit among beer and brine enthusiasts alike.


Turner’s is once again putting a pickled twist on a non-alcoholic summertime classic!
Exclusively for Picklesburgh, Turner’s will be offering a limited-edition Pickled Iced Tea! Turner’s ice-cold beverages are Pittsburgh’s favorite summer refreshment and will be offered as a special edition beverage along with classic iced teas and lemonades at multiple locations around the festival.

NEW! Jenny Lee is gearing up for Picklesburgh with a grilled cheese-and-gherkin sandwich!
World-famous for their swirl bread, Jenny Lee is preparing to launch its own version of a popular pairing: grilled cheese and gherkins! Their new signature sandwich is set to become an instant Picklesburgh classic, combining two buttered-up slices of their famous Garlic & Herb savory bread with Swiss cheese and pickles from Eerie-based Flippin’ Pickles. To give back to the community, Jenny Lee’s is also presenting free kids activities during Picklesburgh at the Li’l Gherkins Kidsplay area. Thanks to Jenny Lee’s, kids will be able to create pickle shaped jewelry and puppets in conjunction with creative staff from Arts Excursions Unlimited.


Mancini’s introduces a new edition of Picklesburgh exclusive PGH Roll!
As the legendary Mancini’s Bakery returns to this year’s Picklesburgh, a new creation joins last year’s sensation, the PGH Roll, made with Heinz pickle chips and Islay’s chipped ham. This year, make room for the new PGH Roll 2.0 made with Silver Star cheesy Bratwurst and pickled cabbage, fresh-baked into an Iron City Beer roll.


An expanded ‘Taste of Picklesburgh’ experience gives dill devotees a head start on the fermented festivities from July 11 through July 21
Those who are pining for Picklesburgh and can’t wait to placate their pickle passion can rejoice as Taste of Picklesburgh returns in a newly expanded format! This year, starting July 11 and continuing throughout the festival until July 21, over 25 Downtown restaurants and retailers will offer a creative array of pickle-inspired food and drink items, gifts, and products. Participating establishments will also distribute free Heinz Pickle Pins with purchase of pickle-themed items, while supplies last.

Three-Time Champ Picklesburgh Nominated Again for ‘Best Specialty Food Festival in America’!

Voting is now open for Picklesburgh fans to defend its #1 status. The festival will make its dill-ightful return to Downtown Pittsburgh on July 19-21, 2024.
The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership (PDP) is excited to dill-iver the best news – confirmed dates for Picklesburgh 2024! And if you’re pining for some early pickled action, Picklesburgh (the #1 Best Specialty Food Festival in America three times in a row) is hoping you’ll cast your vote without dill-ay to retain the title! Voting is open now until March 18 to keep Picklesburgh at #1 in USA Today’s Readers’ Choice Awards!

BRACE YOURSELVES – THE BRINIEST BASH IN THE ‘BURGH WILL RETURN TO BLVD. OF THE ALLIES ON FRIDAY, JULY 19 – SUNDAY, JULY 21, 2024!

Returning for its 9th year, the signature Heinz pickle balloon will once again fly above Downtown Pittsburgh the weekend of July 19th. Produced by the PDP and presented by Kraft-Heinz, Picklesburgh is a free, multi-day festival full of fermented fandom and fun. With dill-icious food from around the region and the world, pickle-themed merchandise, live music, free ‘Lil’ Gherkins’ activities, and a heart-pounding pickle juice drinking contest, there’s something for everyone to relish!

Recognized as a ‘Signature Event’ by the Commonwealth by the Pennsylvania Tourism Office, Picklesburgh has grown every year since launching in 2015and continues to garner national (and international) attention. Last year, the location of the event moved from the Sister Bridges to a larger footprint on Boulevard of the Allies, seeing over 200K people attend and breaking all prior attendance records.

“The festival was originally created to bring people downtown during summer when weekends were quiet, and business was slower. Almost a decade later, I don’t think we could ever have envisioned how the region has embraced this event and made it something so uniquely Pittsburgh,” said Jeremy Waldrup, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership. “We’ve grown significantly every year, and it looks like that will happen again in 2024!”

CAST YOUR VOTES NOW THROUGH MARCH 18 TO HELP PICKLESBURGH DEFEND ITS #1 TITLE!

Picklesburgh is the three-time reigning champion of USA Today’s Reader’s Choice Best Specialty Food Festival in The USA and now’s our chance to help defend the title! You can vote once per day, so don’t dill-ay! Pittsburghers can cast their votes today through March 18 at this link: Vote Now!

More details about the 2024 festival will be announced over the coming months.

FAQS
About us
The Pittsburgh Taco Festival® is an annual food festival aimed at celebrating (and eating) TACOS, as well as supporting and raising funds and awareness for the city’s Latin-American community.

history
The Original Pittsburgh Taco Festival® was founded in 2016 by Craig McCloud who sought to create an opportunity which benefitted food trucks/start-ups as well as support non-profits that serve the city’s burgeoning Latin American population. The festival regularly attracts vendors from beyond the metro area, as well as visitors who plan weekend visits from New York, Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia, and beyond. Over the years, tens of thousands of people have joined us for what has become an annually anticipated cultural and community event. We hope you’ll join us, too!

partners
In addition to the many corporate and national sponsors that support our mission, we are most proud of our cultural partnerships. We work closely with Pittsburgh Hispanic Development Corporation (PHDC) and Casa San Jose, because we wish to honor the cultures responsible for what we consider the ‘greatest hand-food known to man.’ These organizations help us recruit vendors, organize entertainment, and provide authenticity to our taco-themed event. In turn they receive a generous percentage of the net proceeds.

Big Day Entertainment

Little Italy Days started in 2002 to celebrate Bloomfield’s Italian heritage, and create a destination spot for Italian-themed entertainment and food. The event has grown through the years and is now lasts four days.

Sal Richetti, who was born and raised in Bloomfield has produced the event since 2012. Sal grew up in Bloomfield, attended Immaculate Conception grade school and Central Catholic High School. He is a local musician who has been performing for over 30 years in the tri-state area, and is the owner of Big Day Entertainment, located in the Strip District, since 1995. He is no stranger to the festival, having booked the entertainment in previous years. In 2013 he expanded it to four days. Previously, the event was always held in September, since 2013 it has mooved to August. “I wanted to give vendors more opportunity with the longer daylight, additionally; there is less chance of cold weather”

“I am excited and honored to produce this community oriented event in the community where I was born and raised. I want to be able to produce Little Italy Days so the businesses can benefit from the large crowds and everyone else including residents, organizations, schools and churches can become involved.”

Sponsors of Little Italy Days include Official Sponsors – Highmark & Allegheny Health Network, Stage Sponsor – Rohrich Shadyside Honda. Additional Sponsors include UPMC Shadyside, Children’s Hospital of UPMC, PNC Bank, First National Bank, Mascaro, Pittsburgh Brewing Co. First Commonwealth Bank and Froggy’s.

Rules
GAME PLAY
 Two teams of two people, termed partners, shall
play. Partners shall stand at opposite cornhole
boxes on the same side, from the perspective of
a third person, and face each other, so there is
no advantage given to one team.

 Each cornhole team shall have 4 bags of one
color. All 8 cornhole bags begin at one end.

 A coin flip shall determine which cornhole team
has honors in round one.

 One of the partners on the team who has
honors shall begin play by throwing a cornhole
bag at the opposite cornhole box. A cornhole
player may throw from anywhere behind the
front of the cornhole box they are throwing
from. Game continues by alternating throws
between the two opponent players until all 8
cornhole bags have been thrown.

 If a cornhole bag hits the ground then bounces
up onto the board, that bag shall be taken off
the playing surface.

 The next round starts when the other cornhole
player on the team, which has honors, throws
their first cornhole bag.

 The cornhole game continues until one team
reaches 21 or more points.

SCORING
 3 points for a cornhole bag that goes through the hole.

 1 point for a cornhole bag that is on the playing surface.

 1 point for a cornhole bag that is hanging into the hole.

 1 point for a cornhole bag that is hanging off the edge but not touching the ground.

 0 points for a cornhole bag that is on the playing surface, but also touching the ground.

 0 points for a cornhole bag that is hanging off the front edge and is resting on a cornhole bag that is on
the ground (unless the cornhole bag on the ground can be removed without making the hanging bag
fall to the ground, then one point is given).

 The cornhole team with the highest round score, adds the difference of the two scores to their game score.

 The cornhole team who wins the round is given honors to throw first in the next round.

 If both cornhole teams have the same round score then the game score stays the same and honors stays with
the team who had it the previous round.

Praised for his ""pristine, lyrical and intelligent"" playing (The New York Times), Jan Lisiecki returns to perform Mozart’s elegant and effervescent piano concerto. Prokofiev’s Fifth Symphony is filled with grand, sweeping, lyrical music tinged with brooding introspection.

When his Fifth premiered in the US, Prokofiev’s picture graced the cover of Time Magazine, and the magazine’s lengthy profile of him quoted Koussevitzky’s assessment: “[The Fifth Symphony is] the greatest musical event in many, many years. The greatest since Brahms and Tchaikovsky! It is magnificent! It is yesterday, it is today, it is tomorrow.”

The March 7th performance will be broadcast live on WQED.

About this Performance
Forget everything you’ve heard. Join the PSO at Heinz Hall for one-of-a-kind experiences that take you deeper into the music. Whether you’re new to classical music or just want to explore the music in a new way, expect moments of fascination, guided from the stage. This performance features Prokofiev's Symphony No. 5.

Prokofiev’s Fifth Symphony, hailed as “magnificent” and “the greatest since Brahms and Tchaikovsky,” is a sweeping masterpiece of lyrical beauty and brooding introspection. Written in 1944 during the upheaval of World War II, Prokofiev's Symphony No. 5 captures the chaos and emotion of wartime life. Despite the hardship and suffering captured in the music, there is an underlying sense of hope and optimism. A lyrical longing for peace struggles against moments of darkness. Join the PSO as we dive into its history and composition and celebrate the resilience of the human spirit! 

Relaxed atmosphere | Shorter concerts | On-stage host | Signature cocktails

“I invite all our subscribers to experience Disrupt. The fantastic artists of the orchestra explore the emotion and story of the music and composers in new ways. It truly is a fascinating musical experience."" Manfred Honeck

About this Performance
The PSO’s season features works inspired by the natural world: Beethoven’s “Pastoral” you can hear bucolic bird calls, the rolling of thunder, and the calling of a shepherd’s pipes from distant hills. Habibi’s new work was written as a meditation on climate change. Eisendle’s Heliosis, from the Greek word for the sun, is in turn blistering, scorching, and shimmering.

SEAN SHEPHERD: Sprout [PSO Premiere]
KHACHATURIAN: Violin Concerto 
BRAHMS: Symphony No. 4 

About this Performance
Brahms' fourth and last symphony has been called ""one of the supreme creative acts of the Romantic era"" and is fraught with tension between lyrical beauty, intense drama, and subdued melancholy. The violin concerto by Armenian composer Aram Khachaturian, remarkable for its high-flying virtuosity, its yearning melodic intensity, its exoticism, is an under-performed gem in the music repertoire.

About this Performance
First, join us for the pre-show party around Heinz Hall. Enjoy a glass of Bavarian beer or a specialty cocktail from the Biergarten, explore music-themed activities, take photos, and mingle with fellow guests before heading into this short (but epic) performance. 

Forget everything you’ve heard. Join the PSO at Heinz Hall for one-of-a-kind experiences that take you deeper into the music. Whether you’re new to classical music or just want to explore the music in a new way, expect moments of fascination, guided from the stage.

Relaxed atmosphere | Shorter concerts | On-stage host | Signature cocktails

“I invite all our subscribers to experience Disrupt. The fantastic artists of the orchestra explore the emotion and story of the music and composers in new ways. It truly is a fascinating musical experience."" Manfred Honeck

"The Way of Tea: Recital and Ceremony
The Art Room, 2010 Smallman St, Pittsburgh PA 15222
March 10, 2025
6:00 PM-8:30 PM

 

Ceremony
The tea ceremony, or Chado (The Way of Tea), is a traditional Japanese art involving the ritualistic preparation of tea. Influenced by the philosophy of Zen Buddhism, the core teaching of chado is to attain a spiritual state of selflessness and peacefulness through making and sharing tea. Join us to learn the history and philosophy of Japanese tea ceremony while tasting Japanese tea and sweets.

Yuko Eguchi is a native of Tokyo, Japan and holds a Ph.D. in ethnomusicology from the University of Pittsburgh. She received her tea master title and name, Soyu, in 2009 and the associate professor of tea title in 2013, certified by the head master of the Urasenke school. Yuko has performed and lectured on Japanese traditional arts at various higher institutions.

Recital
Japanese mezzo-soprano, Nozomi Kato, is in demand at leading opera houses in Italy, Spain, Japan and beyond. In particular, she has made a name for herself internationally as Suzuki in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, which she will perform at Pittsburgh Opera in March of 2025 reprising her role in a production originated at Cincinnati Opera (dir: Matthew Ozawa).

"Panel Discussion: Women’s Role in Tech, Video Games, Anime, Manga, and Comic Books
East Liberty branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh
130 S Whitfield St, Pittsburgh, PA 15206
March 13, 2025
6:30 PM-7:30 PM

 

Join us at CLP for a free panel discussion with RAD Pass participating organization Pittsburgh Opera where we will explore Women’s Role in Video Games, Anime, Manga, and Comic Books.  Women have often been unrealistically represented in these art forms leading to detrimental outcomes in the real world. This discussion aims to unpack the origins of female representation in art and explore the fine line between fandom and fetish.

 

Pittsburgh Opera leads this discussion in anticipation of its groundbreaking new production of Puccini’s Madama Butterfly. Created by an all-Japanese and Japanese American creative team, the story is set in a fantastical realm where reality and dreams intersect. The male protagonist, Pinkerton, puts on a VR headset and transports us into a vibrant virtual reality playground where he has ultimate control. As his avatar, a U.S. Navy Lieutenant, he can seduce and marry Cio-Cio San, his fantasy girl, and abandon her just as easily. But to Cio-Cio San, this is no game and the love and betrayal she feels is all too real.

 

Attendees receive a discounted ticket offer to the performance of Madama Butterfly of their choice (March 22nd, 25th, 28th, and 30th) and will be entered into a raffle to receive a pair of free tickets. All performances of Madama Butterfly will take place downtown at the Benedum Center.

 

NO REGISTRATION NEEDED!

His escape is her cage.

In this groundbreaking new production created by an all Japanese and Japanese American creative team, Madama Butterfly’s story is transported to a fantastical realm where reality and dreams intersect.

Pinkerton puts on a VR headset and transports us into a vibrant virtual reality playground where he has ultimate control. As his avatar, a U.S. Navy Lieutenant, he can seduce and marry his fantasy girl and abandon her just as easily. But to Cio-Cio San, this is no game and the love and betrayal she feels is all too real.

Enveloped in Puccini’s stunning music, this visually beautiful production is the perfect match. Pittsburgh Opera is proud to partner with Cincinnati Opera, Detroit Opera, and Utah Opera to co-produce this reinvention of Puccini’s classic, uncovering new and resonant meaning for all audiences to enjoy.

SYNOPSIS
slide-plusslide-minus
In the present day, B.F. Pinkerton enters his apartment and dons a VR headset to escape into a fantasy. Within moments, he rejoins a game which transports him to Nagasaki, where he embodies his avatar as a U.S. Navy lieutenant. He inspects a house that he will occupy with his young bride, Cio-Cio- San (a.k.a. Madame Butterfly). Sharpless, the U.S. Consul, arrives, and Pinkerton shares his vision of a sailor in search of pleasure and the beautiful Japanese girl who has captivated him. Sharpless tries to warn him of this view, but Pinkerton laughs, toasting the American girl who will someday be his “real” wife.

Butterfly, her colleagues, and family arrive for the wedding. She tells Pinkerton that since her father’s death, she now earns her living as a geisha. She also has secretly converted to Christianity. The Imperial Commissioner performs the marriage ceremony. Then, Cio-Cio-San’s uncle, the Bonze, bursts in. He curses her, inciting the crowd. Protecting Butterfly, Pinkerton orders the guests away. Butterfly weeps and her new husband consoles her. As night falls in this pleasure fantasy, the lovers share a moonlit duet.

Three years later, modern-day Pinkerton and his American wife have grown distant. His only means of escape is through gaming, where he can manipulate his Japanese bride’s future. In the virtual world, Cio-Cio-San patiently waits for him. Her servant Suzuki implores the gods for aid, but Butterfly bids her to have faith—one day, Pinkerton will return and embrace his wife again.

Sharpless enters with a letter telling of Pinkerton’s marriage to an American. Before he can tell Butterfly, Goro interrupts along with a suitor, Prince Yamadori. Cio-Cio-San refuses his marriage proposal. She brings forth her young son, Trouble, and insists that as soon as Pinkerton knows of him, he will return. If not, she would rather die.

A cannon roars from the harbor, and Butterfly discovers Pinkerton’s ship coming into port. She and Suzuki strew the house with blossoms. As evening falls, she prepares to keep vigil through the night.

Modern-day Pinkerton turns off the game and goes to bed. In the middle of the night, the game turns on, luring him back to play the next level, where he chooses how he will impact Butterfly’s destiny. Pinkerton chooses an American wife avatar, Kate. As the level continues, Butterfly still waits, though Suzuki persuades her to rest. Soon, Sharpless, Pinkerton and Kate arrive. Suzuki realizes who the woman is and reluctantly agrees to inform Butterfly. Pinkerton, now aware of Butterfly’s devotion, bids an anguished farewell and rushes away. Cio-Cio-San hurries in expecting to find her husband, and instead finds Kate. She instantly guesses the truth and touchingly wishes Kate happiness. She says that Pinkerton may have his son if he will return for him.

Butterfly orders Suzuki and Trouble away. She has no choice but to escape this nightmare, and she pulls out the dagger with which her father committed suicide. As she raises the blade to her throat, Trouble appears. Cio-Cio-San drops the knife and embraces him. She then blindfolds him, takes the dagger, and stabs herself. As the fantasy dies, Pinkerton desperately tries to hold onto his creation, Butterfly.

Music by Jennifer Higdon
Libretto by Jerre Dye • APRIL 26, 29, MAY 2, 3, 4, 2025

A family portrait

When Mona finds a mysterious suitcase filled with stolen masterpieces, she must grapple with a choice to save these priceless paintings or save her son—the thief. Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son’s crime, but one of the paintings—Lucien Freud’s “Woman With Eyes Closed”—looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was still young. The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings.

This world premiere opera from award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon (Cold Mountain) is inspired by a real-life art heist, and confronts the question “what is the true value of a work of art?” This is an opera that needs to be seen at least twice; each night of the production has the possibility of a completely new ending!

SYNOPSIS
slide-plusslide-minus
Seven priceless paintings have been stolen from the walls of a museum in the dead of the night. The police, the media, and the museum’s curator are desperate to find the culprit. In hopes of avoiding police detection, the thief (Thomas) has carelessly stuffed the stolen masterworks in a suitcase and abandoned them with his unsuspecting his Mother, Mona.

In her son’s absence, the reclusive Mona investigates the contents of the suitcase discovering both the severity of her son’s crime as well as the innate beauty of each masterpiece. One painting in particular (Lucian Freud’s WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED) awakens something deep inside Mona, shaking her to the very core. The painting bears astriking resemblance to Mona’s Mother, an amateur artist who died when Mona was child. The circumstances surrounding her Mother’s death have reverberated throughout Mona’s life.

The police investigation continues to escalate, bringing an Inspector to Mona’s front door. Though Mona lies to the Inspector, successfully sending him on his way, she also knows that her flimsy deception is merely a temporary fix. The police already have evidence connecting Thomas to the crime. It’s a matter of time before he is apprehended. Mona must act quickly.

Night falls. Mona sleeps. As she dreams, the Freud painting comes to life. Inside a liminal state, Mona and her Mother briefly reunite. Inside this memory, the two women examine the past. They navigate the pain and compromise of a life half-lived, a life starved for color, expression, and connection. Together, they unearth the past trauma that continues to define Mona’s future.

With the dawn comes many burning questions: Can Mona save her son, save herself and save these priceless paintings while simultaneously preserving the memory of her Mother? WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED is a new opera about creation, destruction and the art of letting go.
