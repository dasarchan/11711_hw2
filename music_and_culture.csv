Discover the history of your ancestors at the Irish Genealogy Workshop.

Irish genealogy experts Fintan Mullan and Gillian Hunt from the Ulster Historical Foundation in Belfast are back after a one-year hiatus for the tenth annual Irish Genealogy Workshop, presented in partnership with the Westmoreland Historical Society, on March 4.

Special access to recordings of the lectures will be made available to attendees following the live workshop.

This day-long program will explore new insights into a myriad of historic records and electronic resources. Featuring live Q&A sessions and interactive networking opportunities, this workshop will foster connections between attendees and expert speakers.

Along with experts from the Ulster Historical Foundation, representatives from the History Center’s Detre Library & Archives, the Westmoreland Historical Society, and other local genealogical societies will be on hand to share best practices and tips with visitors and fellow researchers.

This workshop is offered in partnership with the Westmoreland Historical Society, which preserves and interprets the history of Westmoreland County.

This event is now sold out. 
If you are tracing your ancestors in Ireland, a face-to-face consultation with Irish Genealogy experts Fintan Mullan or Gillian Hunt could save you a considerable amount of time and greatly increase your chances of success.

During a 30-minute consultation, you will receive research advice and guidance from Fintan or Gillian who will use their Irish family history knowledge and archival experience to help solve your family tree puzzles.

A consultation is suitable for both the beginner needing guidance on how/where to start and the more experienced researcher who has come up against a “brick wall” in their research.

A personal consultation with the Ulster Historical Foundation is the perfect way to round out a research trip as you will leave with a list of documents to examine, saving you time when you are at the archives.

These sessions are offered in partnership with the Westmoreland Historical Society, which preserves and interprets the history of Westmoreland County.

Admission
Each 30-min consultation session is $60. Individuals are permitted to purchase two consecutive consultation sessions, which results in a one-hour session.

To request accommodations or for more information, contact Sierra Green at 412-454-6361 or sgreen@heinzhistorycenter.org.

The Heinz History Center’s Rauh Jewish History Program & Archives will celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim with a one-night only, participatory experience that blends hand-crafted art and tradition.

Purim commemorates the salvation of the Jewish people in the ancient Persian empire. This is a joyous occasion that is often celebrated with storytelling, gifts, and festive meals.

Join artist Olivia Devorah as they delve into the history of the holiday from the biblical book of Esther and view traditional texts in a new light, taking inspiration from “The Witness Quilt.”

Inspired by the rich colors, textures, and life stories showcased in the Louise Silk: A Patchwork Life exhibition, the Gut Yontif: A Patchwork Holiday Experience series invites emerging artists to reimagine the themes of Sukkot, Chanukah, Tu B’Shvat, and Purim in new works of art.

Often said after the evening service that marks the start of a Jewish holiday, Gut Yontif is a Yiddish greeting that means “have a good holiday!”

Experience these holidays like never before through their unique artistic lenses.

Admission
Admission to this public program is $5 for regular visitors and FREE for History Center members.

Doors open at 6 p.m. and the experience will begin at 6:30 p.m.

Admission includes access to the Louise Silk: A Patchwork Life exhibition.

About the Artist
Olivia Devorah Tucker (they/them) is a Talmud educator, theatre collaborator, challah sculptor, and aspiring Jewish Demonologist. They have been published in Kenden Alfond’s “Feeding Women of the Talmud, Feeding Ourselves” and performed as dramaturg/meturgemon for Ella-Gabriel Mason’s “Queer Jewish: Dancing In Diaspora.” They serve as Program Coordinator / Teacher Training Fairy for SVARA: A Traditionally Radical Yeshiva, and as a co-op member of The Glitterbox Theater in their home of Pittsburgh, PA (Shawnee & Haudenosaunee land). Olivia puts the femme in ephemera & the trans in translation! Find more Olivia here.

Celebrate the joy of girlhood during a multigenerational celebration of storytelling and history.

Presented in partnership with the University of Pittsburgh’s Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, this special day focused on America’s favorite historical dolls will feature a book talk with three American Girl book series authors, a delightful tea party, paper doll making, and more.

Anchoring the program are authors Connie Porter (the ADDY WALKER® series), Jackie Greene (the REBECCA RUBIN ™ series), and Wendy Wan-Long Shang (CORINNE ® series) who will share their experiences writing the powerful narratives of these beloved characters. The trio will discuss how they framed important historical events and issues for younger audiences while also imparting lessons of resilience, friendship, and empowerment throughout.

Ahead of the book talk, kids and kids-at-heart are invited (with their dolls!) to an enchanting tea party that Samantha, Molly, and Felicity would be proud of! Enjoy light refreshments and imaginative play while you sip, savor, and socialize.

Throughout the day, you can also dip into your own childhood nostalgia and design a paper doll with the University of Pittsburgh’s Book Making Club, view girlhood-inspired artifacts in the Detre Library & Archives, learn about the American Girl Doll Lending Program at local libraries, participate in a themed scavenger hunt, and browse the Riverstone Books pop-up shop.

The 2025 History Maker Honorees will be announced soon – check this space for updates!

The 32nd annual History Makers Award Dinner, presented by BNY, will take place on Thursday, June 5, at the Heinz History Center.



Since 1992, the Heinz History Center has honored exceptional individuals whose accomplishments, while rooted here in Western Pa., transcend geographic bounds. History Makers profoundly contribute to the innovative history and collective heritage of our region and represent a commitment to excellence that has defined our community. The History Center is proud to celebrate such individuals and to share their remarkable stories.

Funding raised from the Award Dinner helps to preserve our regional history for future generations and provide a space where experiences and learning moments for all ages help make memories that last a lifetime. The History Center tells the stories of Western Pennsylvanians whose hard work, innovation, enterprise, creativity, and courage improved the world and still serves to guide and inspire us today. Like our History Makers, we are encouraged (but not surprised) by stories of Pittsburgh’s can-do spirit and kindness. After all—we are home to “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.”
